## Key Insights

**Adi Meiri vs Adi Atzmoni**:
- 3 PM sync is with Adi Meiri (Head of Growth/Marketing), NOT Adi Atzmoni (Technical Writer)
- Need to update sola-people.md to clarify both Adis and ensure context is with the right person!

**Time Pressure**:
- Only realistic work block is **8:00-9:30 AM** (90 min) and maybe lunch hour
- Your calendar is PACKED 9:30 AM - 5:45 PM
- This is Day 1 of system - should you timeblock system setup tasks?

**High-Value Options for 8:00-9:30 AM Block**:

1. **Option A - System Setup (Meta Work)**:
   - Time-block next week's calendar (30 min)
   - Install gemini CLI (15 min)
   - Prepare for meetings (review Adi/Shlomi contexts) (15 min)
   - Quick personal task: Yiftach documents? (20 min)

2. **Option B - Deep Work on Onboarding Vision**:
   - Find 'connect and then' experience (30 min)
   - Find 'AI builds without asking' concept (30 min)
   - Add both to onboarding-vision.md (30 min)
   - Sets you up well for strategic discussions with Shlomi

3. **Option C - Quick Wins + Personal**:
   - Install gemini CLI (15 min)
   - Set dentist appointments (10 min - 2 calls)
   - Call designer about resuming (10 min)
   - Yiftach documents (20 min)
   - Time-block next week (30 min)

**Lunch Hour (12-2 PM) - You have choices**:
- Take proper 30 min lunch break (12:00-12:30 or 1:00-1:30)
- Do you attend the 2-3 PM optional meetings?
  - "Pricing and Packages Pre-kickoff" - sounds important for your PM role
  - "Sola Product Overview for Non-Tech" - could be useful context
  - Both are optional, you could skip and use 2-3 PM for work

**Questions for You**:

1. **Morning block (8-9:30 AM)**: Do you want to focus on system setup, deep work, or quick wins?

2. **2-3 PM block**: Are either of those optional meetings important? Or would you rather use that hour for next actions?

3. **Calls during the day**: Can you make quick calls between meetings, or should they be formally time-blocked?

4. **Personal tasks during work day**: Is it okay to do Yiftach documents during work time, or save for evening?

5. **First day priority**: Should Day 1 focus on getting the SYSTEM running smoothly (time-blocking, setup), or jumping into actual work items?

## My Recommendations (For Discussion)

**8:00-9:00 AM** - System Setup + Quick Wins:
- 8:00-8:15: Install gemini CLI ✓
- 8:15-8:45: Time-block next week in Google Calendar ✓
- 8:45-9:00: Review Adi and Shlomi contexts for today's syncs ✓

**9:00-9:30 AM** - Personal High-Priority:
- Check Yiftach documents deadline and send to school (if urgent)

**During Lunch (pick one slot)**:
- Make quick calls: construction engineer (CRITICAL!), dentist appointments, designer call (total 40 min - might need full lunch hour for calls)

**2:00-3:00 PM** - DECISION NEEDED:
- Attend one of the optional meetings? OR
- Use for deep work on onboarding vision

**Between 5:45-6:00 PM** - Day 1 Reflection:
- Quick review: what worked, what didn't
- Update next-actions.md (check off completed items)
