Read .claude/knowledge.md, then help me capture a new learning or insight.

Ask me what I'd like to add, then append it to the appropriate section in knowledge.md with a timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD format).

Sections available:
- Learnings: New things learned, skills acquired
- Insights: Observations, patterns, realizations
- Reference Material: Useful links, commands, snippets
