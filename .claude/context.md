# Project Context

## Overview

This document contains background information and context for ongoing projects and work.

## System Philosophy

This is a **self-organizing work management system** where the repository itself serves as both the knowledge base and the workspace. Everything needed to understand, track, and execute work lives within this system:

- **Living documentation**: Knowledge accumulates in .claude/knowledge.md
- **Active workspace**: Tasks, scripts, and interfaces are created and evolved here
- **Single source of truth**: ROADMAP.md always reflects current reality
- **Progressive enhancement**: The system grows more useful as you use it

The goal is to minimize context switching - instead of using multiple tools and platforms, everything is tracked, built, and maintained in one cohesive structure.
