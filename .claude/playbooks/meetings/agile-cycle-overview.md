- Have dependencies mapped
- Be ready to defend priorities

**During Meeting:**
- Present stories for review
- Incorporate team feedback (especially Shlomi's)
- Adjust priorities based on discussion
- Ensure design alignment (Lior/Ami)

**After Meeting:**
- Finalized prioritized list of sprint candidates
- This list goes to Sprint Planning

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Team (especially Shlomi) approves story quality
- [ ] Priorities are clear and agreed
- [ ] Design is aligned

## Meeting 2: Sprint Planning

**When**: Sunday after Backlog Refinement (5 days later)
**Time**: 17:00

### Purpose
R&D/CTO review the candidate list from Backlog Refinement and decide:
1. What actually goes into the sprint
2. In what order/priority

### Dynamic
- R&D/CTO **challenge** the product list
- Sometimes Product adjusts plans based on technical reality
- Negotiation between business needs and technical feasibility

### Your Role
**Before Meeting:**
- Review the finalized candidate list from Backlog Refinement
- Refresh on business rationale for each story
- Anticipate technical questions/concerns
- Know what's negotiable vs. non-negotiable

**During Meeting:**
- Present/defend candidate stories
- Listen to R&D/CTO concerns and challenges
- Negotiate scope/priority when needed
- Apply "harsh water" approach: push hard, but adapt to constraints

**After Meeting:**
- Sprint backlog is locked
- Sprint starts Monday morning
- Track what got pushed out (for next sprint or later)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Sprint has clear, committed scope
- [ ] R&D has confidence they can deliver
- [ ] Product priorities preserved where critical
- [ ] Compromises made where necessary (but understood)

## Key Relationships in This Cycle

### Shlomi Lavi (VP Product)
- Your boss
- Key reviewer at Backlog Refinement
- Your advocate/partner at Sprint Planning

### Dor Swissa (VP R&D) & Leon (CTO)
- Challenge your priorities
- Bring technical reality
- Sometimes shift your plans
- Respect mutual - "harsh water" dynamic

### Nadav Levy (Senior PM)
- Peer, also preparing stories
- May have competing priorities

### Adi Atzmoni (Principal Technical Writer)
- More than writer - strategic product voice
- Input valuable at refinement

### Design Team (Lior Eli, Ami Yamin)
- Must be aligned before Sprint Planning
- Can't present stories without design ready

---

## Critical Success Factors

### For Backlog Refinement:
1. **Preparation is non-negotiable** - stories must be production-ready
2. **Shlomi's buy-in** - if he's not convinced, R&D won't be either
3. **Design alignment** - no surprises from Lior/Ami

### For Sprint Planning:
1. **Know your WHY** - business value, user impact, strategic importance
2. **Expect challenges** - Dor/Leon will push back; be ready
3. **Be willing to adapt** - "harsh water" means finding alternate paths
4. **Protect what matters** - know what's truly non-negotiable

### Throughout Cycle:
1. **Consistent delivery** - your credibility depends on execution
2. **Clear communication** - keep Shlomi, design, R&D informed
3. **Realistic commitments** - don't promise what can't be delivered
4. **Document decisions** - capture what was decided and why

## Red Flags / Warning Signs

- Stories not ready by Backlog Refinement → scrambling, poor quality
- Shlomi skeptical in refinement → will get worse in planning
- Design not aligned → delays, tension
- Getting overruled often at Sprint Planning → priorities unclear or unrealistic
- R&D consistently pushing back → need better alignment upstream

---

## Notes

This cycle is where your "harsh water" approach is most visible:
- Push hard for what matters
- Absorb constraints from R&D/CTO
- Find alternative paths that still move system forward
- Systemic progression > tactical perfection

This is also where "people start to feel stupid" signal is critical:
- If you run ahead without involving Shlomi/design → frustration
- If R&D feels blindsided → pushback and mistrust
