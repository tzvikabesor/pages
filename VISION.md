# Vision

This document compiles ideas and potential futures into a coherent direction - a north star that guides long-term thinking and priorities.

## Purpose

While the roadmap tracks current work and projects capture active efforts, the vision represents possible futures worth exploring. It synthesizes individual ideas into themes and directions, creating alignment between present actions and future aspirations.

## Relationship to Other Files
