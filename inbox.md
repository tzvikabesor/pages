## To Process

First day back at work.

Dyson is fixed. 

@phone tasks were moved to tomorrow. Things are way too hectic today. focus is only on work.

New tasks:

Create Epic and write stories for billing phase 1 - next action
Exra context for the stories:
* Deletion flow incliudes cancellation - shows an "are you sure" - with a field that the user needs to types their account's name.
* make sure deletion button appears only to owners
* In enterprise, deletion is "deletion request" - sent to support (opens a ticket)

Go over the new Canvas 2 epic, check prioritization. Write the versioning stories. Call was set with Lior for today, I'll add context later.
