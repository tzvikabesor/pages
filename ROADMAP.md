# Roadmap

**ALWAYS CHECK THIS FILE FIRST** before starting any work. This is your single source of truth for what to work on.

This roadmap shows high-level priorities across all projects and standalone tasks. See `PROJECTS.md` for project-specific details.

## Progress Tracking Convention

- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[-]` - In progress
- `[x]` - Completed (with timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD format)

Update task status as you work. Move completed items to "Recently Completed" with timestamps.

**Waiting For**: Items blocked by external dependencies. When unblocked, move to appropriate priority section.
