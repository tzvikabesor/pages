## Project Template

When creating a new project, include:
- `README.md` - Project overview, goals, and current status
- `roadmap.md` - Project-specific tasks, milestones, and "Waiting For" items
- `notes.md` - Working notes, decisions, and context
- Any project-specific folders (src/, docs/, etc.)

Projects should track their own blockers in roadmap.md. Critical cross-project blockers surface in the main ROADMAP.md "Waiting For" section.
