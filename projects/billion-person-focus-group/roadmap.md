## Phase 1: POC (20-30 Hours, 3-4 Weeks)

**Goal:** Prove the methodology works by finding 2-3 surprising insights Sola didn't know.

### Week 1: Setup & Start Listening (6-8 hours)

#### Design (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Define single focused question for research
- [ ] Identify and bookmark 3 data sources (r/cybersecurity, r/netsec, InfoSec Twitter)
- [ ] Set up signal capture system (Google Doc or Notion)
- [ ] Create capture template (Date | Source | Quote/Signal | Tag | Initial Thoughts)
- [ ] Document ethical boundaries

#### Begin Deep Listening (Days 3-7)
- [ ] Day 3: First listening session (30-40 min) - capture 5-10 signals
- [ ] Day 4: Second listening session (30-40 min) - capture 5-10 signals
- [ ] Day 5: Third listening session (30-40 min) - capture 5-10 signals
- [ ] Day 6: Fourth listening session (30-40 min) - capture 5-10 signals
- [ ] Day 7: Fifth listening session (30-40 min) - capture 5-10 signals

### Week 2-3: Intensive Listening & Pattern Recognition (10-12 hours)

#### Daily Listening (Week 2)
- [ ] Day 8: Listening session (1 hour) - focus on recurring themes
- [ ] Day 9: Listening session (1 hour) - focus on contradictions
- [ ] Day 10: Listening session (1 hour) - focus on workarounds
- [ ] Day 11: Listening session (1 hour) - focus on emotional language
- [ ] Day 12: Listening session (1 hour) - focus on behavioral patterns

#### First Pattern Session (End of Week 2)
- [ ] Review all signals collected so far (~50 signals)
- [ ] Run AI analysis through Mind/Heart/Gut lenses
- [ ] Identify initial patterns and contradictions
- [ ] Document emerging themes

#### Daily Listening (Week 3)
- [ ] Day 13: Listening session (1 hour) - validate emerging patterns
- [ ] Day 14: Listening session (1 hour) - seek contradictory evidence
- [ ] Day 15: Listening session (1 hour) - focus on edge signals
- [ ] Day 16: Listening session (1 hour) - deepen strongest patterns
- [ ] Day 17: Listening session (1 hour) - final signal collection

**Target: 75-100 quality signals by end of Week 3**

### Week 4: Synthesis & Deliverable (8-10 hours)

#### Deep Synthesis (4-5 hours)
- [ ] Mind Analysis: Extract rational/stated needs (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Heart Analysis: Extract emotional/cultural patterns (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Gut Analysis: Extract behavioral realities (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Identify 2-3 strong insights with rich evidence
- [ ] Focus on contradictions between say/feel/do

#### Create POC Deliverable (4-5 hours)
- [ ] Write Page 1: Methodology overview (1 hour)
- [ ] Write Insight #1 with evidence and implications (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Write Insight #2 with evidence and implications (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Write Insight #3 with evidence and implications (1.5 hours, if applicable)
- [ ] Review and polish final deliverable (1 hour)

#### Presentation Prep
- [ ] Create talking points for presenting to Sola
- [ ] Practice the pitch
- [ ] Prepare to answer questions about methodology

---

## Phase 1 Success Criteria

- [ ] Found 2-3 insights that surprise the Sola team
- [ ] At least one contradiction between stated vs. revealed preferences
- [ ] Evidence is rich (real quotes, not speculation)
- [ ] Insights are actionable (clear implications for product/strategy)
- [ ] Process is repeatable (team can see how to do this again)

---

## Phase 2: Full Implementation (60-80 Hours, 8 Weeks)

**Note:** Only pursue if POC validates methodology and Sola wants continuous intelligence system.

### Week 1-2: Design
- [ ] Interrogate the brief - define full scope
- [ ] Map all 6 data territories
- [ ] Select prompting philosophy (Poetry + Jazz)
- [ ] Set up comprehensive data sources

### Week 2-4: Sensing
- [ ] Continue manual collection (build intuition)
- [ ] Activate all Five Digital Senses
- [ ] Set up n8n workflows for light automation
- [ ] Establish collection rhythm and boundaries

### Week 4-6: Synthesis
- [ ] Set up Market Signal Inbox (Notion structure)
- [ ] Apply Three Intelligence Layers to all signals
- [ ] Conduct weekly pattern recognition sessions
- [ ] Build pattern recognition systems

### Week 6-7: Shaping
- [ ] Create 3-5 AI personas from collected signals
- [ ] Run simulations with personas
- [ ] Test emerging hypotheses
- [ ] Validate insights with persona feedback

### Week 7-8: Strategizing
- [ ] Develop decision framework
- [ ] Map strategic opportunities (3-5 areas)
- [ ] Create living strategy document
- [ ] Document top opportunities with evidence

### Week 8+: Ongoing Syncing
- [ ] Establish feedback loops
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Set up monthly alignment checks
- [ ] Build continuous intelligence system

---

## Phase 2 Success Criteria

### Qualitative Outcomes
- [ ] Identified 3-5 high-confidence unmet needs with strong signal evidence
- [ ] Discovered at least 2 contradictions between stated and revealed preferences
- [ ] Spotted 2-3 weak signals/emerging trends not yet widely discussed
- [ ] Created 3-5 detailed practitioner personas based on real conversations
- [ ] Documented opportunity spaces with supporting evidence

### Quantitative Metrics
- [ ] 500+ signals collected across all sources
- [ ] 50+ hours of conversations analyzed
- [ ] 10+ sources monitored regularly
- [ ] 3 intelligence layers applied to all major insights
- [ ] 5+ pattern recognition sessions conducted

### Process Validation
- [ ] Methodology is repeatable and scalable
- [ ] Signal-to-insight pipeline is clear
- [ ] Team can operate the listening system independently
- [ ] AI prompting approaches are documented
- [ ] Ethics and boundaries are well-defined

## Waiting For

- [ ] POC completion and validation before starting Phase 2
- [ ] Sola leadership decision on whether to pursue full implementation

---

## Key Decisions Log

**2025-10-11:** Decided to split into 2 phases - POC first to prove methodology, full implementation second if validated

---

## Milestones

- [ ] **M1: POC Started** - Signal collection begins
- [ ] **M2: First Pattern Recognition** - Initial themes identified (end of Week 2)
- [ ] **M3: POC Complete** - Deliverable ready to present to Sola
- [ ] **M4: Go/No-Go Decision** - Sola decides whether to pursue Phase 2
- [ ] **M5: Phase 2 Design Complete** - Full scope mapped, automation planned
- [ ] **M6: Intelligence System Live** - Continuous listening operational
