# Research Plan: Understanding Cybersecurity Practitioners' Needs at Sola

**Goal:** Gain deep, actionable insights about cybersecurity practitioners' needs, pain points, and behaviors that are not currently available through traditional research methods.

## Overview

This plan applies the Billion Person Focus Group® methodology in two phases:

1. **POC Phase (20-30 hours, 3-4 weeks)** - Lean proof-of-concept to validate the methodology
2. **Full Implementation Phase (60-80 hours, 8 weeks)** - Comprehensive intelligence system

The methodology emphasizes:
- **Listening before building** - Understanding what practitioners actually experience vs. what they say they need
- **Multi-dimensional intelligence** - Integrating rational (what they say), emotional (what they feel), and behavioral (what they do) insights
- **Pattern recognition at the edges** - Finding weak signals and emerging needs before they become obvious to everyone
- **Continuous intelligence** - Building an always-on listening system rather than one-off research

---

# PHASE 1: POC (20-30 Hours, 3-4 Weeks)

## POC Goal

**Prove the methodology works by finding 2-3 surprising insights Sola didn't know - especially contradictions between what practitioners say vs. what they actually do.**

Success = Showing the company this approach finds things traditional research misses.

---

## Week 1: Quick Setup + Start Listening (6-8 hours)

### Day 1-2: Design (2-3 hours)

**Single Focused Question:**
*"What do cybersecurity practitioners struggle with that they don't tell vendors?"*

**3 Data Sources Only:**
1. **r/cybersecurity** (500K+ members) - Main hub for daily challenges and tool discussions
2. **r/netsec** - Technical depth and emerging threats
3. **InfoSec Twitter hashtags** (#infosec, #cybersecurity, #blueTeam) - Real-time pulse

**Simple Signal Capture:**
- Use Google Doc or Notion page
- Columns: Date | Source | Quote/Signal | Tag (Mind/Heart/Gut) | Initial Thoughts

### Day 3-7: Begin Deep Listening (4-5 hours)

**Daily Routine (30-40 min/day):**
- Scan top 10-15 discussions across the 3 sources
- Capture 5-10 interesting signals per day
- Look for: frustrations, workarounds, contradictions, emotional language

**What to Tag:**
- **Mind** - Rational statements about needs/features
- **Heart** - Emotional expressions (frustration, anxiety, pride)
- **Gut** - Behavioral patterns (what they actually do)

**Ethical Boundaries:**
- Only public conversations
- No individual tracking
- Focus on patterns, not people

---

## Week 2-3: Intensive Listening + Pattern Recognition (10-12 hours)

### Daily Listening (1 hour/day × 10 days = 10 hours)

**Continue collecting signals, focusing on:**
- Recurring themes across different sources
- What practitioners DO vs. what they SAY they need
- Workarounds (these are behavioral gold)
- Language patterns and metaphors
- What gets high engagement vs. ignored

**Target: 75-100 quality signals by end of Week 3**

### First Pattern Session (2 hours, end of Week 2)

**Use AI to analyze collected signals:**

```
You are helping me recognize patterns across cybersecurity practitioner conversations.
Here are signals I've collected from Reddit and Twitter over 2 weeks [paste signals].

Analyze through three lenses:

MIND (Rational):
- What explicit problems are they describing?
- What features/capabilities are they requesting?

HEART (Emotional):
- What emotions are expressed?
- What cultural values or tensions emerge?
- What professional identity themes appear?

GUT (Behavioral):
- What actions do they report taking?
- What workarounds have they created?
- Where do stated preferences contradict actual behaviors?

Help me identify:
1. RECURRING PATTERNS - Themes appearing across sources
2. CONTRADICTIONS - Where stated needs conflict with behaviors
3. EDGE SIGNALS - Emerging concerns mentioned only by few
4. HIDDEN NEEDS - Unspoken frustrations between the lines
```

---

## Week 4: Synthesis + Deliverable (8-10 hours)

### Deep Synthesis (4-5 hours)

**Run all signals through 3 intelligence layers:**

1. **Mind Analysis** (1.5 hours)
   - What are the rational, stated needs?
   - What logical constraints do they describe?

2. **Heart Analysis** (1.5 hours)
   - What emotions drive their decisions?
   - What cultural values shape the community?
   - What do they aspire to vs. what frustrates them?

3. **Gut Analysis** (1.5 hours)
   - What do they actually do (vs. what they say)?
   - What triggers tool adoption or abandonment?
   - What workarounds reveal unmet needs?

**Goal: Identify 2-3 strong insights with evidence**

Focus on contradictions - these are the gold that traditional research misses.

### Create POC Deliverable (4-5 hours)

**Format: 3-Page POC Report**

#### **Page 1: The Methodology (1 page)**

```markdown
# What We Did Differently

We spent 25 hours over 3 weeks listening to cybersecurity practitioners in their
natural habitats - Reddit, Twitter, technical forums. We didn't ask them questions.
We listened to what they already say to each other.

## The Approach
- 3 data sources (r/cybersecurity, r/netsec, InfoSec Twitter)
- 100+ signals collected
- Analyzed through 3 lenses: Mind (what they say), Heart (what they feel),
  Gut (what they do)
- Focused on contradictions between stated and revealed preferences

## Why This Works
Traditional research (surveys, focus groups) captures what people THINK they want.
This methodology reveals what they ACTUALLY need by observing natural conversations.

## Time/Resources
- 25 hours over 3 weeks
- Free tools (Reddit, Twitter, ChatGPT/Claude)
- Repeatable process
```

#### **Pages 2-3: The Insights (1 page per insight)**

**Template for Each Insight:**

```markdown
## INSIGHT #[N]: [Compelling headline that surprises]

### What We Heard (Mind - Rational Layer)
Quote 1: "[Practitioner stating logical need...]"
Quote 2: "[Another rational requirement...]"
Quote 3: "[Technical feature request...]"

[3-5 quotes showing what they SAY they want]

### What We Felt (Heart - Emotional Layer)
Quote 1: "[Expression of frustration/anxiety...]"
Quote 2: "[Cultural value or identity statement...]"
Quote 3: "[Emotional driver behind decisions...]"

[3-5 quotes revealing emotional undercurrents]

### What We Observed (Gut - Behavioral Layer)
Quote 1: "[Describing actual tool choice/workaround...]"
Quote 2: "[Behavioral pattern that contradicts stated need...]"
Quote 3: "[What they actually do vs. what they say...]"

[3-5 behavioral examples]

---

### THE CONTRADICTION:

Practitioners SAY: [rational statement]
But they ACTUALLY: [behavioral reality]

### WHY TRADITIONAL RESEARCH MISSES THIS:

In surveys/focus groups, practitioners give socially acceptable answers about [X].
In natural conversations, they reveal they actually [Y].

### IMPLICATION FOR SOLA:

[How this changes product strategy, positioning, or messaging]
[What opportunity this reveals]
[What we should do differently]
```

**Example Insight Structure:**

```markdown
## INSIGHT #1: Practitioners Choose "Good Enough" Over "Comprehensive"

### Mind (What They Say)
"Need a comprehensive SIEM with advanced threat detection"
"Looking for enterprise-grade security monitoring solution"
"Want something that integrates with our entire stack"

### Heart (What They Feel)
"Honestly just exhausted by complexity"
"Tired of tools that take weeks to configure"
"Want to go home on time for once"

### Gut (What They Do)
"Switched from Splunk to [simpler tool] - does 20% of features but actually works"
"Built our own Python script - not fancy but we understand it"
"Ignored half the dashboards in [enterprise tool], only use 3 features"

### THE CONTRADICTION:
Practitioners SAY they want comprehensive, powerful, enterprise-grade tools.
But they CHOOSE and ADVOCATE for simple tools that "just work" and don't require a PhD to configure.

### WHY TRADITIONAL RESEARCH MISSES THIS:
In surveys, practitioners give professional answers about needing advanced capabilities.
In natural Reddit conversations, they admit they abandoned those tools for simpler alternatives.

### IMPLICATION FOR SOLA:
Focus messaging on "works in 1 hour, not 1 week" rather than comprehensive feature lists.
Consider "good enough" tier that solves 80% of needs with 20% of complexity.
Practitioners will champion simple tools that work over perfect tools that don't.
```

## The POC Pitch to Sola

*"We spent 25 hours over 3 weeks listening to cybersecurity practitioners in their natural habitats - Reddit, Twitter, technical forums. We didn't ask them questions. We listened to what they already say to each other.*

*Here are 3 things we learned that traditional research wouldn't have found...*

*[Present insights with rich evidence]*

*This methodology costs almost nothing and reveals needs competitors don't see yet. Imagine if we did this continuously."*

---

# PHASE 2: FULL IMPLEMENTATION (60-80 Hours, 8 Weeks)

*Note: This phase is pursued ONLY if POC validates the methodology and Sola wants to build a continuous intelligence system.*

---

## Phase 2 Overview

After the POC proves the methodology works, Phase 2 expands to:
- **6 data territories** (vs. 3 in POC)
- **Light automation** for ongoing signal capture
- **Persona development** for testing concepts
- **Strategic framework** for decision-making
- **Always-on intelligence** system

---

## Phase 2.1: Design (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Interrogate the Brief

**Core Challenge Statement (GET/TO/BY format):**
- **GET:** Deep understanding of cybersecurity practitioners' unmet needs, daily frustrations, and decision-making patterns
- **TO:** Identify product/service opportunities that genuinely resonate with practitioners' real-world challenges
- **BY:** Listening to authentic conversations in natural digital environments where practitioners share unfiltered experiences

**Challenge Type:** Discovery (not validation) - We're seeking to understand what we don't know about practitioners' needs

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. What keeps cybersecurity practitioners up at night that they don't openly discuss with vendors?
2. What workarounds and creative solutions have practitioners developed that reveal unmet needs?
3. Where do current cybersecurity tools and services fail to address emotional and behavioral realities?
4. What emerging challenges are practitioners beginning to discuss at the edges of the community?
5. How do practitioners' stated preferences differ from their actual behaviors and choices?

### 1.2 Map Data Sources Using the Data Exploration Compass

**Primary Data Territories:**

**1. Consumer Dialogue Hubs** (Priority: High)
- **r/cybersecurity** - 500K+ members discussing daily challenges, career advice, and tool experiences
- **r/netsec** - Technical security discussions, emerging threats
- **r/AskNetsec** - Practitioners seeking and sharing advice
- **InfoSec Twitter/X communities** - Real-time reactions to incidents and tools
- **Security StackExchange** - Problem-solving conversations revealing pain points
- **Discord servers** - InfoSec community (invite-only channels where practitioners are most candid)

**2. Cultural Pulse Monitors** (Priority: Medium)
- **Hacker News security threads** - Early adopter discussions and trend signals
- **Security conference hashtags** - Annual pulse checks (BSides, DEF CON, Black Hat)
- **LinkedIn cybersecurity groups** - Professional discourse (more polished but reveals career concerns)

**3. Behavioral Observation Sources** (Priority: High)
- **GitHub security projects** - What tools are practitioners building themselves?
- **Tool comparison sites** (G2, TrustRadius) - Reviews revealing actual vs. promised experiences
- **Stack Overflow tags** (#security, #penetration-testing) - What practitioners struggle to implement

**4. Review & Feedback Ecosystems** (Priority: Medium)
- **Product Hunt security tools** - Early reactions to new solutions
- **Gartner Peer Insights** - Enterprise practitioner reviews
- **Reddit AMAs** with security professionals - Unfiltered Q&A sessions

### 1.3 Select Prompting Philosophy

**Primary Approach: Prompt Poetry + Jazz**

- **Poetry elements** - Use metaphorical questioning to uncover emotional undercurrents and symbolic meanings in how practitioners discuss their work
- **Jazz elements** - Follow unexpected threads, use call-and-response to dig deeper, allow conversations to breathe and reveal patterns
- **Divination sparingly** - For trend spotting and future scenario exploration only after deep listening phase

---

## Phase 2.2: Sensing (Week 2-4)

### 2.1 Choose Collection Approach

**Hybrid: Scrappy + Light Automation**

**Week 2-3: Scrappy Manual Collection**
- Build initial understanding through manual foraging
- Develop intuition for signal quality and context
- Test prompt approaches and refine listening questions

**Week 4+: Light Automation Setup**
- Implement n8n workflows for ongoing signal capture once patterns are understood
- Maintain human review loops to preserve context

### 2.2 Activate the Five Digital Senses

**1. Digital Hearing (Priority: Highest)**
- **What we're listening for:**
  - Language patterns - How do practitioners describe their challenges?
  - Emotional tone - Frustration, anxiety, confidence, burnout signals
  - Metaphors used - What imagery reveals about their experience?
  - Conversation gaps - What's NOT being discussed?

**2. Digital Touch (Priority: High)**
- **What we're observing:**
  - Workarounds mentioned in discussions
  - Tool abandonment stories
  - Implementation challenges shared
  - Integration pain points
  - Time-consuming tasks mentioned repeatedly

**3. Digital Smell (Priority: Medium)**
- **What weak signals we're detecting:**
  - Emerging threats mentioned only by early practitioners
  - New tool categories being invented in comment threads
  - Shifts in regulatory concerns
  - Changing vendor relationship dynamics

**4. Digital Sight (Priority: Low)**
- **Visual signals:**
  - Tool UI complaints in screenshots
  - Dashboard design preferences shared
  - Diagram patterns in explanations

**5. Digital Taste (Priority: Medium)**
- **Resonance signals:**
  - Which posts get most engagement?
  - What solutions generate genuine enthusiasm?
  - What advice gets bookmarked and shared?

### 2.3 Establish Rhythm & Boundaries

**Collection Schedule:**
- **Daily (15-30 min):** Scan top discussions in r/cybersecurity, r/netsec, Twitter security hashtags
- **Weekly (2 hours):** Deep dive into specific threads, AMAs, or long-form discussions
- **Bi-weekly (1 hour):** Review GitHub security projects, product reviews, Stack Overflow patterns

**Ethical Boundaries:**
- Only observe public conversations (no private communities without permission)
- No individual tracking or profiling
- Focus on aggregated patterns, not individual stories
- Respect community norms and guidelines
- Cite sources when sharing insights (anonymized)

---

## Phase 2.3: Synthesis (Week 4-6)

### 3.1 Set Up Market Signal Inbox

**Organization Structure (Notion or similar):**

```

### 3.2 Apply Three Intelligence Layers

**Mind Intelligence Analysis:**
Use AI prompts like:
```
Based on these cybersecurity practitioner conversations [paste data],
analyze the RATIONAL layer:
1. What explicit problems are they describing?
2. What features or capabilities are they explicitly requesting?
3. What logical constraints or requirements are they outlining?
4. What decision criteria are they using to evaluate solutions?
```

**Heart Intelligence Analysis:**
```
Acting as a cultural anthropologist studying cybersecurity professionals,
analyze the EMOTIONAL and CULTURAL layer of these conversations:
1. What emotions are expressed (directly or indirectly)?
2. What cultural values are evident in the community?
3. What professional identity themes emerge?
4. What deeper psychological needs are hinted at?
5. What aspirations or fears are present?
```

**Gut Intelligence Analysis:**
```
As a behavioral researcher, analyze the BEHAVIORAL patterns:
1. What actions do practitioners report taking (vs. what they wish they could do)?
2. What workarounds have they created?
3. What triggers tool adoption or abandonment?
4. What time/resource constraints shape their choices?
5. Where do stated preferences contradict actual behaviors?
```

### 3.3 Build Pattern Recognition Systems

**Weekly Pattern Sessions:**
1. **Review collected signals** across all three intelligence layers
2. **Identify contradictions** - Where do rational, emotional, and behavioral insights diverge?
3. **Spot recurring themes** - What shows up repeatedly across different sources?
4. **Notice edge signals** - What's emerging only in niche discussions?
5. **Map opportunity gaps** - Where are needs unmet?

**AI-Assisted Pattern Recognition:**
```
You are helping me recognize patterns across cybersecurity practitioner insights.
Here are signals collected from multiple sources over 2 weeks [paste data].

Help me identify:
1. RECURRING PATTERNS: What themes appear across different sources/contexts?
2. CONTRADICTIONS: Where do stated needs conflict with revealed behaviors?
3. EDGE SIGNALS: What emerging concerns are mentioned only by early adopters?
4. CULTURAL CURRENTS: What values or tensions shape the community?
5. HIDDEN NEEDS: What unspoken frustrations appear between the lines?

Group insights by strength of signal and potential impact.
```

---

## Phase 2.4: Shaping - Testing Intelligence (Week 6-7)

### 4.1 Create AI Personas

**Develop 3-5 personas representing different cybersecurity practitioner archetypes:**

**Example Persona 1: "Overwhelmed SOC Analyst Sarah"**
```
Name: Sarah, SOC Analyst
Experience: 3 years
Context: Works at mid-size company, handles 200+ alerts/day
Pain Points: Alert fatigue, too many dashboards, manual triage, limited time for deep investigation
Emotional State: Anxious about missing threats, frustrated by false positives, seeking efficiency
Behavioral Patterns: Develops Excel shortcuts, ignores low-priority alerts, seeks community advice on Reddit
```

**Use AI to embody personas:**
```
You are Sarah, a SOC analyst with 3 years experience [full persona details].
I'm going to present you with a product concept. Respond authentically as Sarah would:
- What would genuinely excite you vs. feel like more noise?
- What questions would you immediately have?
- What past experiences would make you skeptical?
- Under what circumstances would you actually adopt this?
```

### 4.2 Run Simulations

**Test emerging hypotheses:**
1. Present product concepts to AI personas
2. Simulate adoption decision processes
3. Explore different market scenarios
4. Identify potential objections and concerns

**Example Simulation:**
```
We're considering building [product concept based on insights].

Simulate a conversation between:
- Overwhelmed SOC Analyst Sarah
- Strategic CISO Marcus
- Hands-on Security Engineer Dev

As they evaluate this solution:
- What would each care about most?
- What objections would surface?
- How would they influence each other?
- What would make this a "yes" vs. "not now"?
```

---

## Phase 2.5: Strategizing - Turning Insights into Action (Week 7-8)

### 5.1 Develop Decision Framework

**Create a prioritization matrix:**

| Insight/Opportunity | Signal Strength | Unmet Need Intensity | Sola Capability Fit | Competitive Whitespace | Priority Score |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| [Insight 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | 1-10 |

### 5.2 Map Strategic Opportunities

**Document top 3-5 opportunity areas:**

For each opportunity:
1. **The Need:** What unmet need have we identified?
2. **The Evidence:** What signals support this? (quote examples)
3. **The Gap:** Why isn't this being addressed by existing solutions?
4. **The Segment:** Who specifically experiences this need?
5. **The Potential:** Why is this opportunity significant for Sola?
6. **Next Steps:** What additional validation is needed?

### 5.3 Create Living Strategy Document

**Format:**
```markdown

## Phase 2.6: Ongoing Syncing (Week 8+)

### 6.1 Establish Feedback Loops

**Lightweight automation (n8n workflow):**
1. **Daily signal capture** from key sources (Reddit, Twitter, Stack Overflow)
2. **Weekly digest email** with new signals categorized by type
3. **Monthly pattern analysis** session to update intelligence
4. **Quarterly deep dives** to identify shifting trends

### 6.2 Create Monitoring Dashboard

**Simple dashboard tracking:**
- Volume of mentions for key topics
- Sentiment shifts over time
- Emergence of new pain points
- Tool adoption/abandonment discussions
- Community energy around different topics

### 6.3 Maintain Market Alignment

**Monthly check:**
- Are our hypotheses still valid?

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Signal Overload
**Mitigation:** Start narrow (3-5 sources), expand only after establishing rhythm

### Risk 2: Confirmation Bias
**Mitigation:** Use AI personas to challenge assumptions, actively seek contradictions

### Risk 3: Privacy/Ethics Concerns
**Mitigation:** Clear boundaries documented, only public sources, no individual tracking

### Risk 4: Analysis Paralysis
**Mitigation:** Weekly synthesis sessions, time-boxed deep dives, bias toward action

### Risk 5: Insights Don't Lead to Action
**Mitigation:** Involve stakeholders early, create decision framework upfront, tie to business goals

---

## Key Methodology Principles Applied

### 1. Listening Before Building
We don't start with product assumptions to validate. We start by deeply listening to what practitioners actually experience, then let insights guide opportunity identification.

### 2. Natural Environments Over Artificial
We observe authentic conversations in spaces where practitioners naturally gather (Reddit, Twitter, GitHub) rather than extracting them into surveys or focus groups.

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Intelligence
We integrate:
- **Mind** (rational/stated needs)
- **Heart** (emotional/cultural dimensions)
- **Gut** (behavioral realities)

This reveals the gaps between what people say, feel, and do.

### 4. Pattern Recognition Over Data Extraction
We focus on connecting meaningful signals into patterns rather than collecting maximum data volume.

### 5. Edges Over Mainstream
We actively seek weak signals, contradictions, and edge cases where future needs first emerge.

### 6. Continuous Over One-Off
We build an ongoing listening system that evolves with the market rather than conducting a single research project.

### 7. Human-AI Collaboration
AI enhances human pattern recognition and synthesis but never replaces human judgment, cultural understanding, and ethical oversight.

---

## Next Steps After Phase 2

If Phase 2 validates the full methodology:

1. **Expand coverage** to additional practitioner segments (DevSecOps, compliance, executives)
2. **Deepen automation** with more sophisticated n8n workflows
3. **Build Oracle** - Create AI-powered market oracle with accumulated intelligence
4. **Scale insights** - Share intelligence across product, marketing, and strategy teams
5. **Establish rhythm** - Integrate listening into ongoing business cadence
6. **Create feedback loops** - Connect product development to real-time market signals

---

## Appendix: Sample AI Prompts

### Initial Discovery Prompt (Poetry Approach)
```
You have access to the collective consciousness of 500,000 cybersecurity practitioners
sharing their authentic experiences on Reddit.

Instead of asking what tools they need, help me understand:
1. What metaphors do they use to describe their daily work?
2. When they discuss "being overwhelmed," what specific moments create that feeling?
3. What do they celebrate in their community vs. complain about privately?
4. What professional identity tensions exist?
5. What dreams or aspirations go unspoken in formal settings?

Speak as their authentic voice - raw, unfiltered, real.
```

### Pattern Recognition Prompt (Jazz Approach)
```
I'm going to share signals from different cybersecurity practitioner sources.
Let's have a conversation to uncover patterns.

[Share initial signals]

First response: What catches your attention most?
[AI responds]

Follow-up: Interesting - let's dig into that. Where else might this pattern show up?
[AI responds]

Challenge: What would contradict this pattern? Play devil's advocate.
[Continue conversation, following interesting threads]
```

### Persona Testing Prompt (Shaping)
```
You are Marcus, a CISO at a 5000-person company. [Full persona details]

I'm presenting you with this product concept: [describe concept]

Respond authentically as Marcus:
1. What's your immediate gut reaction?
2. What questions come to mind?
3. What would you need to see to consider this seriously?
4. What past experiences make you skeptical or excited?
5. Walk me through your actual decision process - who else would be involved?
6. Under what circumstances would this become a "must-have" vs. "nice-to-have"?
```

**Document Status:** V2.0 - Two-Phase Plan (POC + Full Implementation)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11
**Next Review:** After POC completion
