## **Reflection Questions**

After each exercise, consider:

1. What surprised you about what you heard?  
2. What does this tell you about your market that you didn't know before?  
3. Where did you find evidence of real market pull?  
4. What potential challenges did you uncover?  
5. How might this change your approach?  
6. What aspects need more validation?

The key is to treat these exercises not as abstract data collection, but as real conversations with your market through your direct line to their collective consciousness.
