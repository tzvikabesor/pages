# **The 10-Step System for Building Your Oracle AI Listening Engine**

Lesson 2

### THE JOURNEY SO FAR

Let's reflect on the journey that has brought us here:

1. Foundations  
   * Demystifying LLMs: Understanding the true nature of language models, their capabilities, limitations, and inherent blind spots  
   * The Liberal Arts Approach to Prompting:  
     * Prompt Jazz: Improvisational, fluid exploration that follows unexpected threads  
     * Prompt Poetry: Evocative, nuanced prompts that access emotional and symbolic connections  
     * Prompt Divination: Pattern-sensing across seemingly unrelated signals  
   * Hallucination Management: Techniques to identify when AI veers from fact, and strategic ways to leverage creative leaps  
2. Data Collection Fundamentals  
   * Data Foraging (Scrappy Approach): Using the five digital senses to gather intelligence manually  
   * Data Mining (Automation Approach): Leveraging n8n to establish always-on listening posts  
3. The Billion Person Focus Group Engine  
   * Building Your Sensing & Synthesizing Capabilities: Setting up your market signal inbox and second brain  
   * Navigating the Data Landscape: Using the Data Exploration Compass to determine where to focus and which data sources are best for your problem  
   * Data Source Bibles:  
     * Cultural Pulse Monitors: Tools for detecting real-time cultural shifts  
     * Consumer Dialogue Hubs: Sources for accessing raw consumer conversations  
     * and others.

### HOW IT ALL FITS TOGETHER \- THE 10 STEPS FOR BUILDING YOUR ORACLE

Today we're putting all these elements into practice by building your own Oracle and Listening Posts—a systematic framework that transforms these concepts into an actionable intelligence system.  
Phase 1: Design  
This lays the foundation by clarifying exactly what you're looking for and where to find it.

* First, we deeply interrogate the brief to uncover the real challenge beneath the surface request  
* Next, we craft a precise challenge statement using the GET/TO/BY formula to help you understand if the problem is tactical, strategic or about discovery or validation  
* Then we map our data source and terrain using the Data Exploration Compass to choose the right sources  
* Finally, we select a prompting philosophy that shapes how we'll approach our listening

Phase 2: Sensing  
This establishes your systematic approach to gathering meaningful signals.

* We choose between scrappy (manual, intuitive) or automated (scheduled, systematic) data collection  
* We activate the relevant five digital senses to catch different types of signals (visual, linguistic, behavioural, etc.)  
* We establish a sustainable rhythm with clear safeguards and boundaries to ensure consistent, ethical intelligence

Phase 3: Synthesis  
This transforms raw signals into actionable insights and an organized knowledge base.

* We set up our Market Signal Inbox to organize what we find  
* We recognize patterns using both rational analysis and emotional intuition  
* We build our Market Second Brain—a living repository of intelligence that evolves over time

The power of this approach lies in how it integrates everything you've learned so far:

* The prompting approaches you've practiced will guide how you interact with both AI assistants and human communities  
* Your understanding of the five digital senses will determine where and how you collect signals  
* The Data Exploration Compass will help you choose the right data sources and listening terrains based on your specific challenge  
* Your Market Signal Inbox and Second Brain will form the backbone of your ongoing intelligence system (e.g. AI personas , focus groups, architect and AI advisory boards)

This creates a flywheel effect—a continuous learning system that becomes more valuable over time, helping you stay ahead of market shifts rather than just reacting to them.

## **The Workbook**

This [Oracle Listening Post Workbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rFDF_CzXT_RNOFZKGgyptC0O0JztWzDK/view?usp=sharing) will guide you step-by-step through building your Oracle.  
It contains:

* Detailed instructions for each of the 10 steps across all three phases  
* Practical examples showing how others have applied these techniques  
* Templates and frameworks to structure your thinking  
* Space to document your own process and findings  
* Reflection questions to help you continuously improve

As you work through this handbook, remember that building an effective listening post is both a science and an art.  
The frameworks provide structure, but your unique perspective and intuition are what will transform raw data into meaningful insights.  
Let's begin building your Oracle—your own Billion-Person Focus Group™ for continuous market intelligence.
