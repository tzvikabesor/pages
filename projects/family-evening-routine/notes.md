# Family Evening Routine - Notes

## The Need

Build a structured evening routine for the family that ensures:
- Everyone is properly fed
- Walks with Moran (helping her regain shape post-treatment)
- Elisheva does physio and goes to bed before 9 PM
- System works even on days when I arrive home later

## Stakeholders

- Moran
- Moran's parents (help on late work days)
- Elisheva (physio compliance, bedtime)
- Yiftach, Naomi (also need feeding, routines)
- Me (coordination, execution)

## Constraints

- Late work days require help from Moran's parents
- Requires cooperation from Moran
- Needs to be sustainable, not heroic effort
- Multiple competing needs (food, exercise, physio, bedtime)

## Next Steps

Discuss with Sally - she's the balance checker and reality checker for this kind of systemic family work.
