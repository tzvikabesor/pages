# Home Renovation Roadmap

## Immediate - Unblock Project

[ ] Call construction engineer (Gil) to evaluate fit and clarify proposal
    **Questions to ask Gil**:
    1. Scope: Does ₪8,000 include stairwell opening + roof room + pergola, or just roof addition?
    2. Reinforcements: Are all structural reinforcements included beyond jacuzzi (₪1,500)?
    3. Staircase: Does price cover stairwell opening AND staircase design/engineering?
    4. Changes: How are scope changes charged? Do you have an hourly rate?
    5. Supervision: What's included in "superior supervision"? How many site visits?
    6. Payment: Why 75% upon submission? Can payment be tied to more deliverables?
    7. Constraints: Weight limits for roof room? Do you need "as-demolished" plans first?
    8. Contractor support: Ongoing consulting during construction included or extra?

    **Context**: Comparing with Sayag proposal (₪16,500 base vs Gil's ₪8,000). Sayag itemizes: ₪7,500 stairwell + ₪5,000 roof + ₪4,000 pergola. Need to understand if Gil's lower price means different scope or missing items.

    **Reference**: See resources/Renovation sources/ for both proposals
