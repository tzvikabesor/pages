# Financial Control Project - Discovery Questions

*Answer these questions to clarify scope, goals, and approach for building a financial control system*

---

## Section 1: Current State & Pain Points

### 1. What's the current bill tracking situation?
- How do you currently know when bills are due?
- What bills are we talking about? (utilities, subscriptions, credit cards, loans, etc.)
- What typically goes wrong? (missed payments, late fees, uncertainty about what's due?)

### 2. What triggers stress or anxiety about finances?
- Is it uncertainty (not knowing what's due)?
- Is it cash flow (timing of income vs. expenses)?
- Is it complexity (too many accounts/bills to track)?
- Is it shared responsibility with Moran (unclear who handles what)?

### 3. What systems exist today, if any?
- Any apps or tools currently in use?
- Any spreadsheets or documents?
- Any automatic payments set up?
- How does Moran track things on her end?

### 4. What's working and what's not?
- What parts of current financial management feel under control?
- What parts create friction or require too much manual effort?

## Section 2: Goals & Vision

### 5. What does "financial control" mean to you?
Is it:
- Confidence that nothing will be missed?
- Clear visibility into upcoming obligations?
- Better budgeting and planning?
- Reducing mental load about finances?
- Something else?

### 6. What would success look like?
At the end of this project, what would be different? How would you know it's working?

Examples:
- "I can answer 'what's due this month?' in under 30 seconds"
- "No more surprise bills or late fees"
- "Moran and I both know who's handling what"
- "I spend less than 1 hour/week on bill management"

### 7. What level of detail/control do you want?
- High-level oversight (just know nothing is missed)?
- Detailed budgeting (track spending by category)?
- Cash flow planning (know when money comes in vs. goes out)?
- Expense optimization (identify what to reduce/eliminate)?

### 8. How much time/effort are you willing to invest?
- In setup (one-time effort to build the system)?
- In maintenance (ongoing weekly/monthly effort)?

## Section 3: Scope & Boundaries

### 9. What's IN scope for this project?
Check what you want to include:
- [ ] Bill tracking (due dates, amounts)
- [ ] Payment execution (automating payments)
- [ ] Budget tracking (actual vs. planned spending)
- [ ] Expense categorization
- [ ] Shared visibility with Moran
- [ ] Alerts/reminders for upcoming bills
- [ ] Cash flow forecasting
- [ ] Subscription audit (what are we paying for?)
- [ ] Debt tracking (loans, credit cards)
- [ ] Financial goal tracking (savings targets, etc.)

### 10. What's OUT of scope (at least for v1)?
What should be deferred or explicitly excluded?

Examples:
- Investment tracking
- Tax planning
- Long-term financial planning
- Detailed expense analysis

### 11. Who needs access to this system?
- Just you?
- You and Moran?
- Anyone else? (accountant, financial advisor?)

### 12. What's the relationship with existing tools?
- Bank accounts (how many? which banks?)
- Credit cards (how many?)
- Do you want this to integrate with bank data, or be manual entry?

---

## Section 4: Constraints & Preferences

### 13. What tools/platforms do you prefer?
- Spreadsheet (Google Sheets, Excel)?
- Dedicated app (YNAB, Mint, etc.)?
- Notion/Obsidian?
- Simple document/checklist?
- Automation tools (n8n, Zapier)?

### 14. How do you prefer to interact with this system?
- Daily check-ins?
- Weekly reviews?
- Monthly planning sessions?
- Just alerts when something needs attention?

### 15. What's your tolerance for automation vs. manual control?
- Fully automate everything possible?
- Semi-automated (system suggests, you approve)?
- Prefer manual control with good tracking?

### 16. Privacy/security concerns?
- Comfortable linking bank accounts to third-party apps?
- Prefer to keep financial data local/private?
- Need encryption or special security measures?

---

## Section 5: Collaboration with Moran

### 17. What's Moran's role in this?
- Does she handle certain bills/accounts?
- Does she need visibility into the system?
- Does she need to contribute data or just see status?

### 18. What's the current division of financial responsibilities?
- Who pays what?
- Who tracks what?
- How is this decided?

### 19. What would make this work better for both of you?
- Clearer division of labor?
- Shared visibility into everything?
- Better communication about finances?

## Section 6: Risks & Concerns

### 20. What could go wrong with this project?
- Too complex and you abandon it?
- Takes too much ongoing effort?
- Doesn't fit your actual workflow?
- Creates conflict with Moran?

### 21. What past attempts have been made?
- Have you tried to set up bill tracking before?
- What happened? Why didn't it stick?
- What can we learn from those attempts?

### 22. What would make you NOT use this system?
- Too much manual entry?
- Too rigid/inflexible?
- Doesn't match how you think about money?
- Adds more stress than it reduces?

---

## Section 7: Next Steps

### 23. What's the first thing you want to solve?
If you could only improve ONE aspect of financial management right now, what would it be?

### 24. What's the forcing function or deadline?
- Is this urgent because of a specific pain point?
- Or is this "nice to have" for long-term improvement?
- Any external drivers (tax season, loan payments, etc.)?

### 25. How will you know it's time to iterate or evolve the system?
What signals would tell you the system needs adjustment?

**Instructions:**
- Answer whatever questions feel relevant — not all may apply
- Be as specific or general as feels right
- Include examples from real life where helpful
- Note areas of uncertainty — that's valuable too

**When you're done answering:**
- Save this file with your answers
- We'll use these to design a v1 system that fits your actual needs and constraints
