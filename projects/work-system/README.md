# Work System Project

## Overview

Building a comprehensive personal work management system that provides structure and scaffolding for ADHD executive function challenges while supporting long-term goals.

This is not a one-off setup task. It's an ongoing project to reach v1 - a functional system that delivers actual value.

## Problem Statement

**Current state**: Ad-hoc collection of files and manual processes that require constant attention and don't integrate with existing tools.

**What's needed**: An integrated system that:
- Connects to actual work tools (Slack, Jira, Google Calendar)
- Provides automated workflows to maintain routines
- Surfaces the right information at the right time
- Reduces cognitive load rather than adding to it
- Actually gets used because it's valuable, not aspirational

## Goals

### Primary Goal
**Reach v1**: A work system that demonstrably reduces cognitive load and improves focus, delivery, and work-life balance.

### Success Criteria for v1
- [ ] System is used daily without forcing myself
- [ ] Clear reduction in "what should I be doing?" anxiety
- [ ] Time-blocking actually happens and is maintained
- [ ] Work context switches are smoother (less cognitive cost)
- [ ] Can see at a glance: current priorities, blockers, and what's next
- [ ] Feel more in control of both work and personal responsibilities

## Core Components

### 1. Calendar Integration
- Connect to Google Calendar
- Time-blocking workflows
- Visual representation of scheduled vs. actual time
- Integration with task system

### 2. Work Tool Integration
- Slack: Notifications, status, key channels
- Jira: Issue tracking, sprint planning, blockers
- Automatic sync to prevent context switching

### 3. Interfaces & Dashboards
- Daily view: What matters today
- Weekly view: Time allocation, priorities
- Project views: Status, next actions, blockers
- Health tracking: Exercise, sleep, medication

### 4. Automation & Workflows
- Routine maintenance (daily/weekly reviews)
- Automatic task capture from various sources
- Reminder systems that actually work for ADHD brain
- Progress tracking without manual effort

### 5. Agent System
- Still figuring this out
- Potential for proactive assistance
- Context-aware suggestions
- Automated routine tasks

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Basic file structure (ABOUT.md, ROADMAP.md, PROJECTS.md, VISION.md, ideas/)
- [x] Context captured (coaching conversations processed)
- [ ] Define v1 scope clearly
- [ ] Document current tool landscape
- [ ] Identify integration points

### Phase 2: Integration
- [ ] Google Calendar connection
- [ ] Slack integration
- [ ] Jira integration
- [ ] Basic automation workflows

### Phase 3: Interfaces
- [ ] Design daily dashboard
- [ ] Design weekly view
- [ ] Health tracking interface
- [ ] Project status views

### Phase 4: Agents & Automation
- [ ] Define agent capabilities needed
- [ ] Implement routine automation
- [ ] Build proactive assistance features
- [ ] Refine based on usage

### Phase 5: Refinement
- [ ] Iterate based on what actually gets used
- [ ] Remove what doesn't provide value
- [ ] Optimize for sustainability
- [ ] Document patterns for future improvements

## Current Status

**Phase**: Foundation
**Started**: 2024-10-09
**Target v1 completion**: TBD (needs to be scheduled post-Rome trip)

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Calendar integration approach**: What tool/method? What level of automation?
2. **Slack/Jira integration**: Direct API? Third-party tools? Level of sync?
3. **Interface platform**: Web dashboard? Terminal? Notion? Custom?
4. **Agent architecture**: What framework? What capabilities first?
5. **Routine workflows**: What needs to happen daily/weekly for this to work?

## Constraints & Considerations

- Must work with ADHD brain (external structure, not willpower)
- Must reduce cognitive load, not add complexity
- Must integrate with existing tools (Slack, Jira, Google Calendar)
- Must be sustainable (not require constant manual maintenance)
- Must provide value quickly (can't wait months to be useful)
