# Work System Project Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the specific tasks and milestones for building the work system to v1.

## Progress Tracking Convention

- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[-]` - In progress
- `[x]` - Completed (with timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD format)

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Post-Rome, after 2024-10-19)

### Discovery & Planning
- [ ] Document current tool landscape (Slack workspaces, Jira boards, calendar usage patterns)
- [ ] Map out daily/weekly routines that need support
- [ ] Define specific v1 scope (what's in, what's deferred)
- [ ] Research integration options for each tool
- [ ] Decision: Choose calendar integration approach
- [ ] Decision: Choose Slack/Jira integration approach
- [ ] Decision: Choose interface platform (web, terminal, Notion, custom)

### Foundation (In Progress)
- [x] Create project structure (2024-10-10)
- [x] Document project overview and goals (2024-10-10)
- [x] Research productivity systems (PPV, PARA, GTD, Zettelkasten) (2025-10-13)
- [x] Write unified system synthesis (2025-10-15)
- [x] Migrate to unified system structure (2025-10-15)
- [ ] Fill in VISION.md gaps (purpose, vision, goals)
- [ ] Populate VISION.md someday/maybe sections for each pillar
- [ ] Populate area practices.md files (family, work, home practices)
- [ ] Create working notes file
- [ ] Run first weekly review with new system
- [ ] Set up development environment if needed (for custom tools/scripts)

## Phase 1: Calendar Integration

**Goal**: Time-blocking that actually works and integrates with task system

### Tasks
- [ ] Connect to Google Calendar API
- [ ] Build basic time-block creation interface
- [ ] Implement daily/weekly view of scheduled time
- [ ] Create workflow: tasks â†’ time blocks
- [ ] Test: Can I see my day at a glance?
- [ ] Test: Can I adjust blocks easily?
- [ ] Test: Does this reduce "what should I do now?" anxiety?

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Can create time blocks from task list
- [ ] Can see visual representation of day/week
- [ ] Can adjust blocks with low friction
- [ ] System reminds me of scheduled blocks

---

## Phase 2: Work Tool Integration

**Goal**: Reduce context switching between work tools and personal system

### Slack Integration
- [ ] Identify which Slack workspaces/channels matter most
- [ ] Set up Slack API connection
- [ ] Implement notification filtering/routing
- [ ] Test: Does this reduce Slack checking?
- [ ] Test: Am I missing important messages?

### Jira Integration
- [ ] Map relevant Jira boards/projects
- [ ] Set up Jira API connection
- [ ] Sync assigned issues to task system
- [ ] Track blockers and waiting-for items
- [ ] Test: Can I see my work priorities without opening Jira?
- [ ] Test: Am I staying in sync with actual work?

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Can see work context without opening multiple tools
- [ ] Blockers and waiting-for items surface automatically
- [ ] Reduces cognitive load of tracking everything manually

---

## Phase 3: Interfaces & Dashboards

**Goal**: Right information at the right time, minimal cognitive load

### Daily Dashboard
- [ ] Design daily view wireframe
- [ ] Implement daily dashboard
- [ ] Show: Today's priorities, schedule, blockers
- [ ] Show: Health tracking (exercise, sleep, meds)
- [ ] Test: Is this the first thing I want to check in the morning?

### Weekly View
- [ ] Design weekly view wireframe
- [ ] Implement weekly dashboard
- [ ] Show: Time allocation across areas
- [ ] Show: Progress on key projects
- [ ] Show: Upcoming commitments
- [ ] Test: Does this help with weekly planning?

### Project Views
- [ ] Design project status interface
- [ ] Implement for each active project
- [ ] Show: Current status, next actions, blockers
- [ ] Test: Can I understand project state at a glance?

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Dashboards are my first stop, not an afterthought
- [ ] I can answer "what should I focus on?" in seconds
- [ ] Feel more in control, less anxious

---

## Phase 4: Automation & Workflows

**Goal**: System maintains itself, minimal manual effort required

### Routine Maintenance
- [ ] Implement daily review workflow
- [ ] Implement weekly planning workflow
- [ ] Implement capture workflow (from various sources)
- [ ] Test: Can I maintain this without willpower?

### Reminders & Notifications
- [ ] Design ADHD-friendly reminder system
- [ ] Implement context-aware reminders
- [ ] Test: Do I actually respond to these?
- [ ] Iterate based on what works

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Automatic logging of completed tasks
- [ ] Progress visualization for projects
- [ ] Streak tracking for habits (yoga, etc.)
- [ ] Test: Does seeing progress motivate continued action?

### Success Criteria
- [ ] System updates mostly automatically
- [ ] Reminders actually help rather than annoy
- [ ] Can see progress without manual tracking

---

## Phase 5: Agent System (Exploratory)

**Goal**: Figure out what agent capabilities would actually be valuable

### Discovery
- [ ] Research available agent frameworks
- [ ] Document potential use cases
- [ ] Identify highest-value agent capabilities
- [ ] Build proof-of-concept for one capability
- [ ] Test: Is this valuable or just cool?

### Potential Capabilities (TBD)
- Proactive reminder of upcoming time blocks
- Suggest task prioritization based on context
- Automatic capture from Slack/email
- Draft responses to routine requests
- Identify patterns in time usage

### Success Criteria
- [ ] At least one agent capability is genuinely useful
- [ ] Provides value without being intrusive
- [ ] Can envision expanding capabilities

---

## Deferred to Post-v1

Items that are interesting but not critical for v1:

- [ ] Mobile interface
- [ ] Voice capture/interaction
- [ ] Integration with other tools (Notion, etc.)
- [ ] Advanced analytics and insights
- [ ] Sharing/collaboration features
- [ ] AI-powered suggestions beyond basic agents

---

## Waiting For

External blockers:

- Need to schedule dedicated time post-Rome (week of 2024-10-19)
- May need technical decisions/research before some phases
- Some decisions need real-world testing to inform next steps

---

## Key Decisions Log

**When decisions are made, document them here with rationale:**

- TBD: Calendar integration approach
- TBD: Slack/Jira integration approach
- TBD: Interface platform choice
- TBD: Agent framework choice

---

## Milestones

- [ ] **M1: Project scoped** - Clear v1 definition, integration approaches chosen
- [ ] **M2: Calendar working** - Time-blocking functional and useful
- [ ] **M3: Work tools integrated** - Can see work context in one place
- [ ] **M4: Dashboards live** - Daily/weekly views provide actual value
- [ ] **M5: Workflows automated** - System maintains itself with minimal effort
- [ ] **M6: v1 Complete** - System used daily, demonstrable value, ready to iterate
