# Family Food System - Notes

## The Need

Build a sustainable system for:
- Buying groceries (what, when, where, who)
- Preparing food for kids for school
- Lunch planning and preparation
- Dinner planning and preparation

## Current State

[To be documented - what's working, what's not, pain points]

## Goals

- Reduce daily decision fatigue
- Ensure kids have proper nutrition
- Share load appropriately
- Make system sustainable (not dependent on heroic effort)

## Constraints

- Time (especially on work days)
- Energy (especially with Moran's recovery)
- Kids' preferences/needs
- Budget considerations

## Next Steps

Discuss with Sally - this requires systemic thinking about roles, responsibilities, and sustainable patterns.
