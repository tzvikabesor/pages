# Body By Science - Training System

**Purpose**: Document Body By Science (BBS) strength training principles so Claude can track progress and help maintain consistency
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-12

---

## Overview

Body By Science is a high-intensity strength training protocol focused on:
- **Efficiency**: 12-20 minutes once per week
- **Safety**: Slow, controlled movements minimize injury risk
- **Effectiveness**: Maximum muscle stimulation with minimum time
- **Recovery**: Full week between workouts allows proper adaptation

**Your history**:
- Worked out for 10 weeks consistently
- Stopped 6 weeks ago
- Need to find way back

## Core Principles

### The "Big Five" Exercises
[To be filled in - which exercises do you do?]
1. Exercise 1: [Name] - [Muscle groups]
2. Exercise 2: [Name] - [Muscle groups]
3. Exercise 3: [Name] - [Muscle groups]
4. Exercise 4: [Name] - [Muscle groups]
5. Exercise 5: [Name] - [Muscle groups]

### Protocol
- **Frequency**: Once per week (7 days between workouts)
- **Duration**: 12-20 minutes total workout time
- **Movement speed**: [Slow and controlled - specific timing?]
- **Intensity**: To momentary muscle failure
- **Rest between exercises**: [Minimal? Specific timing?]
- **Warm-up**: [Required? How long?]

### Why It Works
- High intensity stimulates muscle growth
- Minimal time commitment makes it sustainable
- Proper recovery prevents overtraining
- Safe movement patterns reduce injury risk

## Your Implementation

### Where You Work Out
- [Gym name/location]
- [Day/time that worked during consistent period]

### What Worked During Your 10-Week Run
[To be documented - what helped you stay consistent?]
- Scheduled time?
- Gym partner?
- Specific day/time?
- Other factors?

### What Caused the Stop
[To be documented - what happened 6 weeks ago?]
- Schedule change?
- Motivation issue?
- Injury/health concern?
- Other barrier?

### Barriers to Overcome
[To be documented]
- Getting to gym?
- Finding time?
- Energy/motivation?
- Other?

## Progress Tracking

### Workout Log Format
```
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Exercise 1: Weight X lbs, Time X seconds to failure
Exercise 2: Weight X lbs, Time X seconds to failure
Exercise 3: Weight X lbs, Time X seconds to failure
Exercise 4: Weight X lbs, Time X seconds to failure
Exercise 5: Weight X lbs, Time X seconds to failure
Total time: X minutes
Notes: [How did it feel? Any issues?]
```

### Goals
- **Consistency**: 1x per week for 12 consecutive weeks
- **Progressive overload**: Increase weight when time to failure exceeds [X seconds?]
- **Safety**: No injuries, proper form maintained
- **Integration**: Fits into life without excessive friction

## Connection to Your Why

From ABOUT.md:
- **"Training for the centenarian decathlon"** - being active, capable grandfather
- **Physical capability** - long-term health and independence
- **Physical wellbeing directly impacts everything else** - ADHD management, work performance, emotional regulation

This isn't optional. It's medicine.

## Restarting After Break

### Phase 1: First Workout Back
- Expect to use lighter weights than before
- Focus on form and safety
- Don't try to match previous performance
- Goal: Successful completion, not maximum intensity

### Phase 2: Weeks 2-4
- Gradual progression back to previous levels
- Establish routine consistency
- Identify and address any friction points

### Phase 3: Weeks 5+
- Back to full intensity
- Progressive overload
- Habit solidified

## Questions to Answer

1. **Specific exercises**: What are the Big Five you do?
2. **Movement speed**: What's the specific timing (e.g., 10 seconds up, 10 seconds down)?
3. **Previous weights**: What were you lifting during your consistent period?
4. **Gym details**: Where, when did you go?
5. **What broke the streak**: What happened 6 weeks ago?
6. **Barriers to restart**: What's keeping you from going back?
7. **Success factors**: What helped you maintain the 10-week run?

## Integration with Work System

### Time-Blocking Connection
- 12-20 minutes once per week
- Can fit into "reclaimed time" as part of timeboxing experiment
- Low time commitment, high return

### Calendar Integration
- Block specific day/time
- Set up as recurring event
- Protect this time like a meeting

### Habit Stacking
- Connect to existing routine (e.g., "Every Saturday morning after breakfast")
- Reduce decision fatigue by making it automatic

## Next Steps

1. **Fill in the details** - Answer questions above about specific protocol
2. **Identify restart date** - When will first workout back happen?
3. **Address barriers** - What needs to change to make this sustainable?
4. **Set up systems** - Calendar blocks, gym bag ready, friction removed
5. **Track first month** - Document what works and what doesn't
