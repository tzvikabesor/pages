# About Tzvika

## Who I Am

I'm Tzvika, 50 years old, a product manager, husband to Moran, and father of three (ages 15, 12, and 8). I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 44 - a discovery that explained decades of struggle and opened the door to profound transformation. I'm an INFP Enneagram 9, working to build what I didn't receive in childhood: secure attachment, self-advocacy, and sustainable success patterns.

## My Story

### Early Life - Growing Up with Emotional Scarcity

Born in Holon to lower-middle-class parents (father at Israel Aircraft Industries), I was raised by second-generation Holocaust survivors who couldn't contain emotional difficulties. My mother had very low cognitive intelligence; my father is likely on the autism spectrum. As a smart kid, I carried heavy pressure to achieve while receiving no emotional support. By high school, academic struggles began. Military service as a communications officer was emotionally blunting - I lost access to my feelings, experiencing any emotion as threatening.

### The Winding Career Path

After the army, I dropped out of psychology/sociology studies (second semester) - couldn't handle the pressure of getting anything less than perfect. Film school at Tel Aviv University became catastrophic due to performance anxiety.

My internet career began in forums where my writing talent emerged. This led through:
- Sports reporter and news editor at Nana
- Early product work (though not officially recognized)
- Startup attempt with friend (raised $1M, killed by 2008 crisis)
- Difficult job searches, poor interview performance
- Marketing management with stressful performance-based pay
- Sumoto (fired after 3 years of conflicting demands)
- Browsewor (twice - both ended badly)

By 2019, facing another firing, I was desperate. Everything felt like proof that I was fundamentally broken.

### The Transformation - Discovering ADHD

In our first conversation, my coach Sally said: "What you're describing sounds like ADHD." I'd never considered it.

The diagnosis at age 44 changed everything. On medication (Concerta), suddenly I could:
- Focus for sustained periods without heroic effort
- Complete detailed work systematically
- Be present with my children without constant internal noise
- Experience calm instead of perpetual chaos

Decades of "character flaws" - laziness, lack of discipline, careless errors, inability to finish - were actually executive function challenges. Not moral failings. Neurological differences.

### Five Years of Intensive Therapy (Ages 30-35)

Before the ADHD diagnosis, I spent five years in psychotherapy that was transformative. I learned to:
- Identify and name emotions (mine and others')
- Understand how childhood neglect shaped my patterns
- Begin breaking down emotional walls
- Start hearing what others actually needed

This laid crucial groundwork, even though I was still fighting the underlying neurological battle.

### Current Chapter - Building What I Didn't Have

The last 5+ years with Sally have been about:
- Learning to deliver consistently before leading with brilliant ideas
- Building systems and habits that actually stick
- Developing secure attachment through family relationships
- Finding my voice and advocating for my needs
- Discovering that physical health directly impacts everything else
- Transforming from someone who couldn't maintain any exercise routine to someone who does yoga 2x/week as non-negotiable

Most significantly: I've built a home. Not just a house, but a secure base of love with Moran and our children. For the first time in my life, I know what it feels like to not have to earn love through performance.

## Current Context

### What I Do

**Work**: Senior Product Manager leading growth and AI experiences at Sola (started 2024)
- Managing multiple teams and building AI capabilities
- Established as trusted voice - "whatever Tzvika does, he does well"
- Navigating path toward senior IC (individual contributor) rather than traditional management - specifically aiming to be a **captain** (leading by doing) not a coach (managing people)
- Learning to lead with delivery and stakeholder management, not just strategic vision
- Building coalitions and communicating proactively with leadership

**Success at Sola means people can confidently answer two questions**:
1. Can you trust Tzvika to get things done once he takes responsibility?
2. Does Tzvika know what he's talking about — even beyond his direct product scope?

**Early warning sign I'm out of sync**: When people start to feel stupid — that's the signal. It means I'm running ahead without sharing context, creating frustration on both sides.

**My work pattern evolution**:
- Before: Brilliant ideas → poor execution → frustration → conflict → eventual termination
- Now: Consistent delivery → earned trust → space for strategic thinking → sustainable success
- Next: Improving stakeholder communication to harness them to vision in "live stream" → gain more trust → affect more

### What Matters to Me

**Core values that guide decisions**:

1. **Family First**: My children and Moran are the foundation. Work is important but it's a "day job" - meaningful but not my primary identity.

2. **Authenticity Over Performance**: Being genuine rather than hiding or performing. I don't perform - I **translate**: adjusting how I express myself so others can receive it, but the source remains true. Translation isn't performance when it serves understanding.

3. **Growth Through Process**: Focusing on sustainable systems and habits rather than dramatic outcomes. The journey IS the destination.

4. **Presence**: Being here now with the person in front of me, not lost in anxiety about the future or regret about the past.

5. **Impact Through Delivery**: Making actual difference requires finishing things, not just having good ideas. Vision and execution are interdependent — two horses pulling the same carriage. Vision without delivery is speculation; delivery without vision is grind.

6. **Physical Wellbeing**: My body directly affects my mind. Exercise, sleep, and nutrition aren't optional extras.

7. **Simplicity**: Avoiding excessive obligations, debt, and complications that reduce freedom.

8. **Belonging as Received**: Learning to accept that I'm liked, loved, and respected without needing to earn it moment-by-moment. Letting this be a default, not a project.

### Current Needs

**To maintain stability and continue growing**:

- **Consistent sleep** (7-8 hours): Critical for ADHD management and emotional regulation
- **Hydration**: Need to drink more water throughout the day
- **Regular exercise**: Yoga 2x/week minimum (currently compromised, need to get back on track), Body By Science strength training (stopped 6 weeks ago after 10-week run, need to find way back), walking
- **Structure and systems**: External scaffolding for executive function (calendars, task management, routines)
- **Recovery time**: As an introvert in an extroverted role, I need quiet time to recharge
- **Clear priorities**: Knowing what's actually important vs. what's just urgent
- **Support communicating needs**: Ongoing work to advocate for myself, especially at home
- **Home renovation progress**: This has been stuck and is creating background stress
- **Balance at home**: More equitable distribution of responsibilities with Moran

### Current Wants

**Aspirations and areas of exploration**:

- **Senior IC career path**: Building the role I want rather than accepting traditional management track. Aiming for principal or staff-level PM whose opinion carries strategic weight through trust and clarity, not title.

- **AI product expertise**: Becoming known for the **human side of AI** — blending intellectual rigor (what AI does) with emotional rigor (how humans experience it). Keeping AI human — intellectually, emotionally, and ethically. Bridging the gap between technical potential and human experience.

- **Writing projects**: Potential book on masculinity or popularizing sociology

- **Work efficiency**: Reducing work hours through better systems while maintaining impact. Not doing less, but doing work so well that less effort is required. **Leading indicator**: increase in time available during work week without loss of output or influence.

- **The Timeboxing Experiment**: Time-blocking my way into having a work-free day (8-10 hours) in the calendar. Long game goal: offer Sola a 4-day workweek arrangement. Starting with 2 hours/week of blocked personal time during work hours, expanding incrementally to 8-10 hours (one workday) with bi-monthly reviews. Proving sustainability before asking permission.

- **Reclaimed Time for Life Infrastructure**: Initially using reclaimed time for home improvements, family logistics, practical life management — rebalancing effort from corporate systems to personal systems.

- **Physical capability**: "Training for the centenarian decathlon" - being active, capable grandfather

- **Deeper friendships**: More time and energy for meaningful social connections

- **Creative projects**: Space for writing, thinking, creating beyond work

- **Financial simplicity**: Minimizing obligations and complexity

### Current Challenges

**What I'm actively working through**:

1. **The "Everything Is On Me" Pattern**: Feeling sole responsibility for family wellbeing, home maintenance, etc. Learning to set boundaries and share load more equitably.

2. **Moran's Health Journey**: She recently completed cancer treatment (now in remission). Supporting her while managing my own needs.

3. **Home Renovation Paralysis**: House needs significant work, but I'm stuck between taking action and feeling overwhelmed. Multiple factors: cost anxiety, coordinating with professionals (triggers "being stupid" feelings), and ambivalence about the outcome.

4. **Sustainable Work Intensity**: Learning to say no, delegate, and build systems that reduce my hours while maintaining impact.

5. **Authority Dynamics**: Still activates old patterns of either rebellion or over-compliance. Getting better but remains a growth edge. Now see that people in power are often insecure — having authority doesn't mean feeling safe. This helps me approach authority with empathy instead of opposition.

6. **Advocating for Needs**: Decades of training to not burden others with my needs. Learning to say "this is hard for me" and "I need help." I tend to let things go too easily because I can contain discomfort — but silence has a cumulative cost on how I'm perceived and positioned.

7. **Secure Attachment Through Expression**: Building trust by expressing needs and discovering people don't disappear. Security isn't declared — it's proven through small, repeated experiences of stability.

8. **Saying No With Connection**: Know how to say no, but working on manifesting comfort within relationships so boundaries feel natural, not oppositional. Say no from connection, not defense.

## Working Style

### How I Work Best

**Optimal conditions for thriving**:

1. **Clear focus with autonomy**: Know the priority, have space to work my way, but with regular check-ins
2. **Meaningful work**: Connected to values and real impact
3. **Strong relationships**: Trust with team and stakeholders
4. **Systems over willpower**: Task management, calendars, routines that provide external structure
5. **Physical wellbeing**: Exercise, sleep, nutrition directly impact cognitive performance
6. **Preparation time**: As an introvert, I perform better in meetings/presentations when I can prepare
7. **Recovery time**: Need quiet time between high-social-demand activities
8. **Processing time**: I think by talking things through, but need space to consolidate afterward

**Work style insights**:

- **INFP in PM role**: Naturally introverted but can "be E" when needed. Works well when I can prepare and recharge.

- **P vs. J**: Naturally perceiving (flexible, adaptable) but must develop judging functions (planning, closure) for PM success. Need **fuzzy-aware timeboxing** — systems that accommodate partial knowledge and evolving clarity. Focus on modes ("deep work," "alignment," "maintenance") rather than predefined tasks.

- **Detail work**: With medication and systems, can now handle detail work that was previously impossible

- **Communication need**: Must over-communicate to stakeholders, especially upward - this doesn't come naturally

- **Strategic decision-making**: "Harsh water" approach — push hard initially, but absorb constraints and find alternative paths. Focus on systemic progression, not tactical perfection. Always move the system forward, even if the path bends.

- **Strategic vision + execution**: Have strong intuition about where things should go, but must balance with incremental delivery

### Things to Keep in Mind

**Context for anyone working with this system (including future me)**:

**About my ADHD**:
- I take Concerta 54mg daily - this is non-negotiable
- "Forgetting to remember the future" - distant things don't feel real/urgent without external systems
- Need to over-communicate and over-structure compared to neurotypical people
- Emotional regulation is tied to physical state (exercise, sleep, nutrition)
- Hyperfocus can be asset or liability depending on whether it's directed appropriately

**About my patterns**:
- **Enneagram 9**: I naturally merge with others' agendas and avoid conflict. This means I need to actively work on voicing my needs and disagreements.
- **Historical trauma responses**: When criticized or facing authority, may revert to either rebellious or overly compliant patterns. Growing awareness helps me catch and correct this.
- **Identity remapping post-ADHD**: Ongoing work separating essence from coping mechanisms. Treating "I can't see the whole picture" as a design constraint, not a flaw.
- **"Come back to the horse"**: I will have setbacks with habits/systems. The skill is returning quickly without shame.
- **Charisma/energy management**: I can inspire and excite people, but must channel this intentionally rather than leading with it

**About my needs**:
- Physical movement is not optional - it's medicine
- I need explicit permission/encouragement to take time for myself
- I struggle to advocate for needs with authority figures (including coaches, bosses, and Moran)
- Silence usually means I'm struggling, not that everything's fine
- **Vulnerability safety**: I can be open anywhere that power is safe within itself. Unsafe when power meets insecurity — when someone has authority but lacks inner stability

**About my growth edges**:
- Setting boundaries and saying no
- Communicating needs before reaching crisis
- Asking for help early
- Trusting that delivery + communication will create space for strategic thinking
- Accepting that I don't have to be brilliant to be valuable

## Context for Decisions

### Why This System Matters

I've spent decades watching brilliant ideas dissolve because I couldn't execute consistently. I've lost jobs despite being smart. I've hurt relationships by not communicating needs until I exploded.

This work system is my scaffold. It's external structure that compensates for executive function challenges. It's also a practice ground for:
- Showing up consistently (which builds trust)
- Communicating clearly (which builds relationships)
- Tracking progress (which builds confidence)
- Celebrating small wins (which sustains motivation)

### The Integration of Work and Life

For years, I kept work and personal life separate in my head. But they're not separate. When I'm:
- Sleep-deprived → work suffers
- Not exercising → emotional regulation fails
- Stressed at work → less present with family
- Overwhelmed at home → can't focus at work

This system helps me see the whole picture and make decisions that support all of it.

### The Long Game

I'm 50. I have potentially 20+ productive years ahead. But only if I:
- Take care of my body
- Maintain strong relationships
- Build sustainable work patterns
- Continue psychological/emotional growth

**Optimizing for capacity under uncertainty**: Given family health and a volatile world, I'm investing in capacities that matter in any scenario — stronger body, steadier mind, more mature systems. No fixed picture by choice; building resilience for whatever comes.

Quick wins and dramatic changes don't serve me. Steady, sustainable progress does.

### Success Redefined

**Success used to mean**:
- Recognition as brilliant
- Impressive titles
- Startup exit
- Being right when others were wrong

**Success now means**:
- Coming home energized, not depleted
- Being present with my children
- Healthy body that lets me do what I want
- Work that's engaging but not all-consuming
- Financial stability without excessive obligations
- Time for creativity, friendship, rest
- Feeling "I have a home" - secure base of love
- Modeling healthy living for my children

### Decision-Making Framework

When evaluating projects, work, or major life choices, I ask:

1. **Does this align with my values?** (Family, authenticity, growth, impact, simplicity)
2. **Is this sustainable?** (Or will it require unsustainable heroics?)
3. **Does this build or deplete my foundation?** (Sleep, exercise, relationships)
4. **Am I choosing this or just merging with someone else's agenda?** (Type 9 trap)
5. **What's the process, not just the outcome?** (Will I enjoy the journey?)
6. **Am I being realistic about my capacity?** (Accounting for ADHD, recovery needs, other commitments)

## Open Questions & Future Directions

**Crossroads on AI × Product vs. Social Impact**: Currently feeling genuine tension between deepening in AI/product thought leadership and redirecting toward social or civic impact work. Not ready to decide. For now: establish foundation and credibility at Sola while staying open to broader possibilities. Re-evaluating quarterly.

**What Would "Arrived" Look Like?**: Uncertain. Revisiting every few months to ask: which path feels more alive — continued growth in AI/product or transition toward social, ethical, or political contribution?
