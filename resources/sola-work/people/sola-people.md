### Shlomi Lavi - VP Product

**Relationship to Tzvika**: Direct manager

**Context**:
- Backlog Refinement (key reviewer - approval critical)
- Sprint Planning (product advocate to R&D)
- Bi-weekly 1:1s (Tzvika/Shlomi sync)
- Q4 planning sessions
- Strategic product decisions

**Working Style / Notes**:
- Values delivery + communication over just brilliant ideas
- Skeptical in refinement → will be worse in planning (pattern to watch)
- If he's not convinced, R&D won't be either
- Need his buy-in before presenting to Dor/Leon
- Currently very tactical in 1:1s (from his side)
- [To be expanded as patterns emerge]

**The Core Challenge with Shlomi**:
Tzvika's work pattern has shifted from "Brilliant ideas → poor execution → frustration → conflict" to "Consistent delivery → earned trust → space for strategic thinking." He's **learning to lead with delivery and stakeholder management, not just strategic vision**.

The challenge: Tzvika has product vision for Sola but hasn't found the right way to present it, get Shlomi's feedback, and iterate it. This makes tactical execution harder because the vision isn't clear/shared. Need to figure out how to move from purely tactical 1:1s to strategic alignment that makes tactical pieces flow better.

**Key Insight from ABOUT.md**:
- "Vision and execution are interdependent — two horses pulling the same carriage"
- Vision without delivery is speculation
- Delivery without vision is grind
- Success = delivery + communication creating space for strategic thinking
- Must over-communicate to stakeholders, especially upward (doesn't come naturally)

**Open Issues / Topics to Discuss**:
- [ ] **STRATEGIC**: Present growth and AI experiences product vision - get feedback, iterate together (with Shlomi and leadership: Guy, Ron, Leon)
- [ ] **TACTICAL**: Q4 priorities for growth and AI - clarify trade-offs
- [ ] **CAREER**: Senior IC path progression - when to formalize conversation?
- [ ] **PERFORMANCE REVIEW**: Year-end review approaching (since started 2024) - what do I want? what do I ask for? how do I get it? (compensation, status, recognition)
- [ ] **PROJECT**: Canvas2 resource allocation and timeline
- [ ] **PROJECT**: AI app builder - strategy to deprecate in favor of CS agent handling all building
- [ ] **PROCESS**: How to balance tactical execution with strategic vision in our 1:1s?
- [ ] **STRATEGY**: MCP-first thinking and building a ChatGPT app
