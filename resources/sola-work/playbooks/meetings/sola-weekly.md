## Pre-Meeting Preparation (5 minutes)

### Key Question:
**Do I have something the entire company needs to hear?**

Consider:
- [ ] Major product updates or launches?
- [ ] Cross-team initiatives that need visibility?
- [ ] Strategic insights worth sharing?
- [ ] Recognition or celebration opportunities?
- [ ] Clarifications that would help company alignment?

### If YES:
- [ ] Prepare 2-3 bullet points (keep it concise)
- [ ] Consider: Does this need Guy/Shlomi's heads-up first?
- [ ] Optional: Draft message in advance for clarity

### If NO:
- [ ] Just show up and listen
- [ ] Be ready to engage with team updates
- [ ] Note anything relevant to fashion domain work

## Notes

**Last Used Speaking Privilege**: Never (as of Oct 2025)

**When to Consider Speaking**:
- You have information that reduces uncertainty company-wide
- Recognition that would energize the team
- Alignment that prevents duplicate work
- Perspective that shifts how people think about the business

**When NOT to Speak**:
- It's really just relevant to your domain (use other channels)
- It's about you being seen vs. company benefit
- It should go through Shlomi first
- You're not clear on the message yet
