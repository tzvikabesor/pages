## Core Question

How does the CS (Coding Sidekick) get the user to value in onboarding?

## Concepts to Explore

### 1. "Connect and Then" Pattern
*[To be added: saved experience where "connect your AWS" pops up]*

User sees clear path: connect â†’ immediate value.

### 2. "AI Builds Without Asking, Then User Edits"
*[To be added: concept where AI proactively builds something, user can edit/approve]*

Two sub-approaches:
- With suggestions (AI proposes options)
- Without suggestions (AI just does it, user can modify)

### 3. Close the Gap: Build Canvas from Anywhere with CS
*[To be developed: Jira story for this capability]*

Remove friction between intent and creation.

### 4. MCP-First Thinking
*[To discuss with Shlomi]*

Consider building ChatGPT app, MCP integration as core onboarding path.
