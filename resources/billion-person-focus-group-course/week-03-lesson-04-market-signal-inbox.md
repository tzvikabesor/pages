# **The Market Signal Inbox \- Your Digital Reception Center**

Lesson 2

## **Lesson Synopsis**

This lesson focuses on building your Market Signal Inbox \- a simple but powerful system for capturing all those valuable observations you come across daily. We'll tackle the frustrating problem of finding great customer insights, competitor moves, or market trends but having nowhere consistent to put them. You'll learn the difference between what belongs in your Signal Inbox (and what doesn't), compare straightforward options for setting it up in Airtable or Notion, and see how to organize signals using the Five Digital Senses framework. With step-by-step instructions and practical examples, you'll create a reliable system for capturing market intelligence before it disappears. By the end of this lesson, you'll have built your first defense against information overload \- a central collection point that makes sense of the market signals bombarding you each day.
