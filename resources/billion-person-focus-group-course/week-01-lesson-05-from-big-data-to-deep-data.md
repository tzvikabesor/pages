# **Practical Exercises: From Numbers to Narratives**

A practical exploration of finding meaning beyond metrics

## **Why These Exercises Matter**

The prompts and exercises in this module aren't just standalone explorations \- they're building blocks for your data strategy. Each exercise helps map potential data sources and insight opportunities that will become crucial when we move into practical analysis in later modules.

## **Suggested Approach**

1. Complete all exercises, even if some seem less relevant now  
2. Document your findings carefully \- you'll reference them later  
3. Look for connections between different exercises  
4. Keep your maps and insights accessible  
5. Update your findings as new insights emerge

## **Remember**

* These exercises create your insight foundation  
* Each component supports future analysis work  
* The more thorough you are now, the more effective your later analysis will be  
* You're building a toolkit, not just completing exercises

Think of this module as creating your personal atlas of insight opportunities \- one you'll reference throughout your data journey.

## **Next Steps**

1. Work through each exercise systematically  
2. Document your findings clearly  
3. Note questions that arise  
4. Begin thinking about which areas you'd like to analyze first  
5. Keep this work accessible for future modules

The time you invest now will pay dividends when we move into practical analysis techniques.

## **Core Exploration Areas**

### 1\. Mapping Your Dark Data Universe

### 

Markdown  
One of our key metrics is **\*\*\[specific metric, e.g., 'free trial conversion rate,' 'customer lifetime value'\]\*\***. Currently, it's at **\*\*\[current level, e.g., '23%,' '$2,400'\]\*\***. Using the CTFAR model (Circumstances → Thoughts → Feelings → Actions → Results), help me understand: 1\. Three distinct scenarios that could lead to this same result 2\. The environmental and cultural factors influencing each path 3\. Key emotional triggers and decision points 4\. How different customer segments might experience each path 5\. Potential intervention points where we could positively influence the journey For context: \- Our typical customer is **\*\*\[brief description\]\*\*** \- They usually find us through **\*\*\[channels\]\*\*** \- The main value we provide is **\*\*\[value proposition\]\*\*** Expected Output Format: For each scenario: \- Circumstances: \[External context\] \- Thoughts: \[Customer's internal dialogue\] \- Feelings: \[Emotional state\] \- Actions: \[Observable behaviors\] \- Results: \[Measurable outcome\] \- Key Insights: \[What this reveals about our customers\] \- Opportunity Areas: \[Where we could improve the experience\]  
Markdown  
Here's a piece of customer feedback from **\*\*\[source, e.g., 'support ticket,' 'product review'\]\*\***: **\*\*\[Insert actual feedback\]\*\*** Help me analyze this feedback to uncover deeper insights by examining: 1\. Emotional undertones and intensity 2\. Cultural and contextual factors 3\. Underlying needs or jobs-to-be-done 4\. Behavioral patterns and triggers 5\. Systemic issues or opportunities Consider: \- What isn't being said explicitly? \- What assumptions might we be making? \- What cultural or contextual factors might be influencing this feedback? \- What broader patterns might this represent?" Expected Output Format: \- Surface Message: \[Literal meaning\] \- Emotional Layer: \[Feelings and intensity\] \- Cultural Context: \[Relevant social/cultural factors\] \- Root Causes: \[Underlying issues/needs\] \- Pattern Recognition: \[How this connects to broader trends\] \- Action Items: \[Specific next steps\]

### 3\. Emotional and Cultural Resonance
