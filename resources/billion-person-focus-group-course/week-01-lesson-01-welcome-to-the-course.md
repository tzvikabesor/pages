# **Welcome to the Course\!**

Lesson 1 â€¢ COMPLETED TUE. AUG 26  
Hey there\!  
Welcome to this week's module on reimagining market research in the age of AI. I'm really excited about what we're going to explore together, because I promise you \- it's going to change how you think about understanding your market forever.  
This week isn't about tools or techniques \- not yet.  
Instead, we're focusing on something more fundamental: a complete mindset shift in how we approach market research.  
We'll explore why traditional research often leads us astray, how AI can be a portal to deeper market understanding, and why the Billion-Person Focus Group isn't just a tool \- it's a whole new way of listening to your market.  
Each lesson comes with two parts:

1. A podcast-style audio lesson where we'll dive deep into these concepts, sharing stories and insights that challenge conventional wisdom  
2. Practical exercises designed to help you start shifting your mindset and seeing your market in a new light

The exercises aren't just busy work \- they're laying crucial groundwork for next week, when we'll roll up our sleeves and actually start building your own Billion-Person Focus Group.  
Think of this week as training your mind to see differently, so that when we get to the practical tools, you'll be ready to use them in ways that most people never think of.  
This week's journey will guide you through some fundamental mindset shifts:

* From Disconnection to Connection From seeing your market as something to conquer to something to connect with. Stop trying to "penetrate" markets and start flowing with them. Understand why 85% of products fail and how deep connection changes everything.  
* From Consulting Oracles to Becoming One From treating market research as a step-by-step process to seeing it as an intuitive dance with your market. Learn how great businesses act as modern oracles, sensing shifts before they happen.  
* From MVP to Product Market Flow From building what's "minimally viable" to creating what deeply resonates. Understand why the traditional MVP approach often leads to lukewarm market reception, and how to build products that people naturally want to pull into their lives.  
* From Big Data to Deep Data From drowning in data to discovering meaning. Learn why 99.5% of business data goes unused, and how to find the signals that matter in the noise. Stop counting and start understanding.  
* From Research to Resonance From seeking validation to embracing truth. Transform how you listen to your market using the Billion-Person Focus Group, and learn why traditional research often reinforces our blind spots instead of revealing new insights.

Each shift builds on the last, preparing you for next week when we'll turn these insights into action.  
The exercises aren't just theoretical \- they're designed to reshape how you see your market, your customers, and the very nature of business intelligence.  
Remember, we're not just learning new tools \- we're developing new eyes. And that's going to make all the difference in how you build your business.  
So grab your notebook, open your mind, and get ready to challenge everything you thought you knew about market research.  
The future of market understanding isn't about more data \- it's about deeper listening.  
And that's exactly what you're going to learn.  
Let's begin this journey together.
