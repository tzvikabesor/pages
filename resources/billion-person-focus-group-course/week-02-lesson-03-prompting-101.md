# **Prompting 101**

Lesson 3

## **Introduction to The 'Liberal Arts' Approach to AI Prompting**

Forget everything you've heard about "prompt engineering" \- this module introduces a completely different way of working with AI that draws from the liberal arts rather than computer science. We'll show you how approaches inspired by poetry, jazz, and pattern recognition can get remarkably better results than technical methods.  
Throughout these lessons, you'll discover why creative thinkers often extract deeper insights from AI than technical experts, and how shifting from giving commands to having conversations transforms what's possible. Whether you're using AI for business insights, creative work, or strategic planning, this liberal arts approach will help you access levels of understanding that technical prompting simply can't reach.  
Learning Outcomes:

1. Understand why creative approaches to AI often yield deeper insights than technical "engineering" methods  
2. Master a three-layer framework (Poetry, Jazz, and Divination) for more effective AI interactions  
3. Learn to craft questions and conversations that reveal patterns and connections traditional approaches miss  
4. Develop practical workflows that turn AI-generated creative insights into actionable business strategies  
5. Build confidence in using AI as a thinking partner rather than just a question-answering tool

This module is designed for anyone who wants to get more from AI tools \- no technical background required. In fact, if you have experience in areas like writing, teaching, counseling, arts, or humanities, you may find you have unexpected advantages in this new approach to AI interaction.

## **Lesson 2: Introduction to AI Hallucinations (and how to manage them)**

What if AI making things up isn't always bad? This session takes a fresh look at AI "hallucinations" \- when AI generates information that seems plausible but isn't factual. We'll explore when you need accuracy versus when imagination is actually helpful. You'll learn practical techniques for both keeping AI factual and for purposefully using its ability to spot patterns and possibilities. By the end, you'll know how to turn what many consider AI's biggest weakness into a powerful tool for innovation.  
Learning Outcomes:

1. Tell the difference between unhelpful AI fabrications and valuable creative insights  
2. Learn five straightforward ways to keep AI factually accurate when needed  
3. Discover how to intentionally use AI's pattern-finding abilities for innovation  
4. Create a balanced approach that maintains both accuracy and creativity  
5. Know when to focus on facts versus when to explore new possibilities

## **Lesson 3: Introduction to Prompt 'Poetry' (Transforming Your Questions for Deeper Insights)**

Transform how you ask questions to get insights that standard approaches miss. This isn't about flowery language \- it's about using techniques from poetry to access deeper understanding. Learn how metaphors, symbols, sensory awareness, and noticing what's missing can reveal important business insights that direct questions often overlook. Through practical examples, you'll see how these techniques generate useful, actionable insights while staying grounded in business reality.  
Learning Outcomes:

1. Use metaphors to better understand complex business challenges  
2. Identify key moments that shape customer experience through symbolic thinking  
3. Uncover usability issues by focusing on how users physically and emotionally experience products  
4. Create prompts that explore what's missing or not being said to find overlooked opportunities  
5. Develop questions that generate practical business insights beyond what standard approaches reveal

## **Lesson 4: Introduction to the Jazz Layer \- (How to have dynamic, insightful conversations with AI)**

Move beyond one-time prompts and discover the power of back-and-forth AI conversations. This session shows how to shift from giving commands to having collaborative exchanges, using techniques inspired by jazz. Learn how call-and-response, riffing on ideas, asking unexpected questions, using strategic pauses, and building complexity gradually can lead to much deeper insights. You'll learn to create "Riff Cycles" \- planned conversation sequences that help you explore topics thoroughly while remaining flexible enough to follow interesting discoveries.  
Learning Outcomes:

1. Shift from giving commands to having meaningful dialogues with AI  
2. Use five conversation techniques to create more productive AI interactions  
3. Design effective conversation sequences that balance planning with flexibility  
4. Develop skills for following up on interesting points during AI conversations  
5. Create workflows that build understanding through step-by-step exploration

## **Lesson 5: Introduction to the Divination Layer (prompting for pattern recognition)**

Learn to use AI's ability to spot emerging trends and imagine possible futures. This session shows how to transform what many consider AI's tendency to "make things up" into a valuable tool for forecasting and innovation. You'll learn practical techniques for detecting early signals of change, exploring possible future scenarios, examining unusual cases, and more. Through real examples, you'll see how companies have used these methods to spot opportunities their competitors missed.
