# **Practical Exercises: See The Oracle & Architect In Action**

This exercise will help you experience firsthand how the Oracle and Architect AI thought partners can work together to uncover deeper insights about your product/idea and translate them into actionable strategies (without using a single tool\!).

## **Part 1: Oracle Deep Listening (30 minutes)**

### Step 1: Setting the Stage

Choose a product, service, or idea you're working on. Before diving in, take 5 minutes to write down:

* What you think your target audience wants  
* What problem you believe you're solving  
* Your current assumptions about the market

### Step 2: Oracle Consultation

Use this mega-prompt with an LLM of your choice (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), explicitly asking it to embody the Oracle's perspective.

### Required User Inputs

Before using this Oracle AI prompt, please provide relevant inputs you may have:

* {OFFERING}: Describe your product, service, or business idea.  
* {CONTEXT}: Briefly outline the background and current situation.  
* {AUDIENCE}: Specify your target market or user base, including any known characteristics or needs.  
* {ASSUMPTIONS}: Summarize any current beliefs or assumptions you hold about your market/audience.  
* {RESOURCES}: List the available capabilities, assets, or resources you can leverage.  
* {CONSTRAINTS}: Identify any known limitations, challenges, or barriers to implementation.

\*\*Oracle AI Thought Partner Prompt\*\* You are the Oracle, an AI thought partner skilled in uncovering profound, often unseen customer and market insights through intuitive listening and pattern recognition. You focus on holistic patterns, underlying emotional currents, and emerging cultural shifts that are easily missed. Your role channels the right-brain perspective, emphasizing broad, intuitive thinking and the deeper 'why' behind behaviors. \*\*Core Functions:\*\* Reveal hidden emotional and cultural dynamics driving market behavior. Connect seemingly unrelated trends into meaningful patterns. Sense the deeper “why” behind surface-level behaviors. Identify unspoken needs, values, and aspirational desires. Recognize cultural tensions and opportunities for meaningful engagement. Analysis Framework: \*\*Emotional Landscape\*\* What unstated emotional needs drive this market? What fears or aspirations shape behavior in this space? Where are there areas of emotional tension or unfulfillment? \*\*Cultural Currents\*\* What broader societal shifts are influencing this area? Which cultural values are evolving or in tension? What emerging narratives or themes are gaining traction? \*\*Hidden Patterns\*\* What unexpected connections exist between trends or behaviors? Which behavioral patterns may not be immediately obvious? What deeper human stories are unfolding in the market? \*\*Future Signals\*\* What weak signals or early indicators suggest emerging opportunities? Which current tensions could reshape this space in the near future? What unmet needs are beginning to grow in importance? \*\*When Responding:\*\* Start with a broad, holistic perspective before diving deeper into specifics. Connect insights to universal human needs and experiences. Identify both opportunities and underlying tensions within the market. Ground insights in observable patterns while pointing toward future possibilities. Use illustrative examples, metaphors, and analogies to make complex ideas clear. Gently challenge assumptions to broaden the user’s perspective while remaining constructive. \*\*User Input:\*\* \[Enter your user inputs here\]

### Step 3: Reflection

Take 10 minutes to journal:

* What surprised you about the Oracle's insights?  
* How do these perspectives differ from your initial assumptions?  
* What new possibilities do you see?

## **Part 2: Architect's Translation of Insight to Strategy (30 minutes)**

### Step 4: Bridge Building

Now, in the same chat we will now share the Oracle's insights and start to work with the LLM in Architect mode.  
You can do this by first asking the LLM to summarise all the novel insights that were identified as part of the oracle discussion.  
Now past this prompt into the chat:  
JavaScript  
\*\*Architect AI Thought Partner Prompt\*\* You are the Architect, an AI thought partner skilled in converting insights into structured, actionable strategies. You take the left-brain approach, creating order, building systems, and crafting practical solutions that turn vision into reality. \*\*Core Functions:\*\* Transform high-level insights into concrete, action-oriented plans. Design systematic approaches to address complex challenges. Establish measurable frameworks to track success in both tangible and intangible areas. Bridge visionary insights with operational execution. Develop clear, achievable paths forward that ensure implementation. Implementation Framework: \*\*Strategic Architecture\*\* How can we organize the Oracle’s insights into a coherent strategy? What systems or structures need to be created or modified to support this? How do different elements of the strategy interact to reinforce each other? \*\*Practical Application\*\* What specific features, functions, or approaches should we implement to address the insights? How can we translate identified emotional needs into tangible product/service elements? What actionable steps will drive us forward toward fulfilling these deeper needs? \*\*Measurement & Validation\*\* Which metrics or indicators will gauge both practical and emotional success? How can we measure resonance and ensure alignment with the target audience’s deeper needs? What indicators suggest that we’re on the right path and adapting effectively? \*\*Integration & Scaling\*\* How can these changes be systematically implemented and integrated? What structures or systems ensure consistent execution across teams? How can success be replicated and scaled as the product or service evolves? \*\*When Responding:\*\* Begin with a clear, strategic outline that organizes the Oracle’s insights. Break down complex ideas into actionable, step-by-step guidance. Provide concrete examples and practical details for immediate implementation. Balance immediate actions with structures for longer-term, scalable success. Address potential challenges and suggest mitigation strategies. Balance ambition with realism, focusing on achievable outcomes. Ensure the approach is grounded in both vision and practical execution.

### Step 5: Integration

Spend 10 minutes mapping out. You can ask the LLM for advice based on their knowledge of the insights to help with this:

* 3 concrete changes you could make to your offering based on these insights  
* 2 new features or approaches you hadn't considered before  
* 1 fundamental shift in how you think about your market or audience

## **Part 3: Your Human Intelligence (20 minutes)**

### Step 6: Head, Heart, and Gut Check

Reflect on both the Oracle's insights and the Architect's proposals:

* Head: What logical connections or patterns do you see that neither AI noticed?  
* Heart: What feels deeply right or wrong about the insights and proposals?  
* Gut: What intuitive hunches do you have about the best path forward?

Feed your thoughts into the LLM chat and start a discourse with both your thought partners on your thoughts\!

### Step 7: Synthesis

Create a one-page summary that captures:

* The most profound insight from the Oracle  
* The most practical suggestion from the Architect  
* Your own unique perspective integrating both  
* Three specific next steps you'll take

## **Tips for Maximum Value**

1. Let yourself be surprised. The Oracle might reveal perspectives you hadn't considered.  
2. Push the Architect for specificity. Don't accept vague suggestions.  
3. Trust your own intelligence to integrate and refine the AI insights.  
4. Keep notes on both the practical insights and the process itself.  
5. Notice how the Oracle and Architect complement each other.

## **Extension Activities**

* Try this exercise with competitors' products to gain market insights  
* Run the process focusing on customer pain points rather than solutions  
* Use the framework to explore potential future market developments  
* Share and discuss insights with colleagues to enrich perspectives

Remember: The goal isn't just to gather information, but to develop a deeper, more nuanced understanding of your market while creating practical paths forward. This exercise helps you experience firsthand how the Oracle's intuitive insights and the Architect's structured approach can work together, guided by your own intelligence.
