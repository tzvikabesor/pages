# **Demystifying LLMs 101**

Lesson 2  
This lesson challenges conventional thinking about AI and introduces a new approach to using LLMs for insights work. Rather than viewing AI as a "thinking machine" that replaces human intelligence, the lesson presents it as a powerful listening tool that enhances our ability to perceive and interpret information. What we'll cover:

## 

1. How LLMs Actually Work  
   * Understanding LLMs as pattern prediction systems, not reasoning entities  
   * Challenging the myth of AI as an all-knowing intelligence  
2. AI's Knowledge Sources and Limitations  
   * Books: Classic literature, nonfiction, academic works (but missing recent publications)  
   * Websites & Open-Access Articles: Wikipedia, news, blogs (missing paywalled content)  
   * Online Forums: Reddit, Quora, Stack Exchange (missing major social platforms)  
   * Popular Media: Movie transcripts, podcasts (missing deeper cultural understanding)  
   * Visual Content: Art collections, stock photography (limited aesthetic understanding)  
3. Major Blind Spots in AI Knowledge  
   * Oral histories and indigenous knowledge  
   * Non-English and minority-language data  
   * Embodied and tacit knowledge (experiential understanding)  
   * Real-time cultural conversations and current events  
4. Actionable Insights for Using AI Effectively  
   * Recognize that AI reinforces what it's trained on  
   * Direct AI's attention intentionally toward overlooked perspectives  
   * Maintain the essential role of human intuition and cultural understanding  
   * Look for insights at the edges of knowledge, not in mainstream data

## 

The most valuable insights come from directing AI to listen where others aren't listening. Understanding AI's limitations is crucial for leveraging it effectively as a complementary tool to human intelligence rather than a replacement.

## **1\. So how do LLMs work under the hood?**

Welcome to a fresh perspective on Large Language Models (LLMs)\! In this lesson, we’ll challenge the way you think about AI and introduce a game-changing approach to using it for insights work. Forget the idea of AI as a “thinking machine” that replaces human intelligence—instead, discover how it can act as a powerful listening tool, enhancing your ability to perceive and interpret information. We’ll break down how LLMs actually work, showing you how they predict patterns, not think or reason. Get ready to reimagine what’s possible with AI\!

## **2\. The Myth of All-Knowing AI \- what exactly is AI listening to anyway?**

## 

Most people assume that AI systems like ChatGPT or Claude:

* Have full access to the entire internet  
* Are plugged into real-time events and news  
* Continuously learn from human conversations  
* Update their knowledge automatically

The reality is very different. AI is only as good as its training data, which consists of specific, curated content that was available at the time of training. Understanding these limitations is crucial for using AI effectively for insight work. So what is AI trained on?

### 1\. Books: AI's Deepest Knowledge Wells

What AI has access to:

* 📖 Classic Literature: Works in the public domain (Shakespeare, Austen, Orwell)

* Offers historical context and theoretical foundations across disciplines

What's missing:

* 🚫 Recent copyrighted books and latest thought leadership  
* 🚫 Niche, radical, or independent works that challenge mainstream paradigms  
* 🚫 Field-specific expertise from unpublished sources (whitepapers, insider knowledge)

Key insight: AI's book knowledge is vast but selective and often outdated. It's shaped primarily by what has been digitized and made publicly available.

### 2\. Websites & Open-Access Articles

What AI has access to:

* 🌍 Wikipedia: Structured knowledge but edited by a limited group with potential biases  
* 📰 News Articles : Open-access news sources (not premium/paywalled content)  
* 📑 Blogs & Public Writing: Platforms like Medium, WordPress, research summaries  
* 💼 Corporate Websites: Public-facing company content  
* Academic Papers

Why this matters for insights:

* Provides insight into how knowledge is framed and discussed publicly  
* Captures mainstream narratives, trends, and discourse  
* Offers a window into public-facing corporate positioning

What's missing:

* 🚫 Paywalled journalism and premium content  
* 🚫 Non-mainstream websites and radical perspectives  
* 🚫 Alternative media, indigenous knowledge, countercultural movements

Key insight: AI understands mainstream discourse but not the voices and perspectives that fall outside dominant narratives.

### 3\. Online Forums & Social Media

What AI has access to:

* 💬 Reddit & Quora: Long-form discussions, debates, and user-generated answers  
* 💡 Stack Exchange: Technical Q\&A across various domains

Why this matters for insights:

* Captures how real people discuss issues in conversational settings  
* Reveals common concerns, misconceptions, and emerging discussions  
* Helps AI understand the patterns of human conversation and debate

What's missing:

* 🚫 Most major social platforms (Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok)  
* 🚫 Private communities (Slack groups, Discord servers, members-only forums)  
* 🚫 Cultural nuance from emerging platforms and youth culture

Key insight: AI's visibility into social conversation is limited to public, archived discussions—missing the raw, intimate conversations shaping real culture.

### 4\. Popular Media & Entertainment

What AI has access to:

* 📺 Movie & TV Transcripts: Dialogue from films and series  
* 🎙️ Podcasts & YouTube Transcripts: Public-facing discussions  
* 📚 Comics & Graphic Novels: Some visual storytelling elements

Why this matters for insights:

* Provides context on how stories shape cultural narratives  
* Captures dialogue patterns, humor, and storytelling techniques  
* Helps AI understand cultural references and emotional framing

What's missing:

* 🚫 Deep semiotic and aesthetic interpretation  
* 🚫 Niche and subcultural references  
* 🚫 Visual and experiential elements beyond text

Key insight: AI can recognize cultural references but doesn't truly understand cultural symbolism on a deeper level.

### 5\. Art, Photography & Design

What AI has access to:

* 🖼️ Art Collections: Open-access databases of famous artworks  
* 📸 Stock Photography: Labeled images and visual themes  
* 🎨 Design Platforms: Sites like Behance and Dribbble

Why this matters for insights:

* Enables AI to detect visual styles and aesthetic trends

## **3\. What Are The Major Blind Spots in AI's Training Data and Knowledge**

### Oral Knowledge:

### AI cannot "hear" what has never been written down, missing entire knowledge systems that exist outside text-based documentation.

### What's missing:

* Traditional wisdom passed down through storytelling, not text  
* Indigenous knowledge systems and cosmologies  
* Community practices, rituals, and spoken traditions

Why this matters:

* Many societies rely on embodied, experiential knowledge transmission  
* AI skews toward Western, text-based epistemologies  
* The unrecorded often contains the deepest cultural intelligence

### Non-English & Minority-Language Data: AI listens primarily through an English-speaking lens, missing the cultural depth embedded in other languages.

What's missing:

* Most indigenous and minority languages  
* Cultural nuance expressed through language-specific concepts  
* Dialectical variations and culturally-specific expressions

Why this matters:

* Language is inseparable from cultural worldview  
* AI reinforces linguistic hierarchies and Western perspectives  
* Limits AI's ability to understand global cultural diversity

### Embodied & Tacit Knowledge:

### AI is a pattern-matching system, but humans are sensing beings. The intelligence that lives in the body will always remain beyond AI's reach.

What's missing:

* Experiential understanding that comes through the body  
* Intuitive expertise that can't be fully articulated  
* Emotional and sensory dimensions of human experience

Examples:

* A chef's sense of when a dish is perfectly seasoned  
* An artist's intuition for composition and balance  
* A market analyst's "feel" for emerging trends

Why this matters:

* Much of human intelligence is not intellectual—it's felt  
* AI cannot grasp embodied meaning or tacit knowledge  
* The gap between description and experience remains unbridgeable for AI

### Real-Time Cultural Conversations:

AI's knowledge is frozen in time, making it blind to current developments and emerging trends unless specifically updated.  
What's missing:

* Current events beyond the training cutoff date  
* Emerging slang, memes, and cultural references  
* Fast-moving cultural shifts and social dynamics

Why this matters:

* Markets and cultural trends move in real-time  
* AI cannot track emerging movements until they're documented  
* Relying solely on AI means always being one step behind

## **The Big Takeaway: Your Role is to Direct AI's Listening**

AI is not a neutral observer of human knowledge. It reflects specific training data, with specific limitations and exclusions. This has profound implications for how we use AI for insights:

1. AI reinforces what it's trained on. If it's only trained on dominant, mainstream sources, it will reinforce those perspectives.  
2. We must direct AI's attention intentionally. To gain valuable insights, we need to point AI toward overlooked voices, perspectives, and knowledge sources.  
3. The human role remains essential. AI cannot replace human intuition, cultural understanding, and lived experience—these must work together.  
4. The most valuable insights live at the edges. True discovery happens not in what everyone already knows, but in what's emerging, overlooked, or unheard.

## **So how do I do this?**

We are going to learn how to do this and select the right data sources in a later module (don't worry I got you).
