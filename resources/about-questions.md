## Notes on Using These Questions

These questions aren't meant to be answered all at once. They're for:

1. **Periodic reflection**: Pick a few during planning sessions or when making decisions
2. **Conversation starters**: With Sally, Moran, close friends, or even GPT
3. **Decision frameworks**: When facing a choice, find relevant questions here
4. **Noticing patterns**: Over time, see which questions keep coming up
5. **Measuring growth**: Revisit old answers to see how perspectives have shifted

The questions will evolve as you evolve. Some will become irrelevant as issues resolve. New ones will emerge as new challenges arise.
