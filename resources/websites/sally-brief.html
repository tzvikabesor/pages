        <h1>My New Work System: A Brief for Sally</h1>

        <h2>What I Built</h2>
        <p>Over the past few months, I've built a comprehensive personal work management system that lives entirely in code—working with Claude in a development environment. It's not just a to-do list; it's an integrated system for managing tasks, projects, knowledge, and life itself.</p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>You know better than anyone: I've spent decades watching brilliant ideas dissolve because I couldn't execute consistently. Lost jobs despite being smart. Hurt relationships by not communicating needs until I exploded.</p>

        <p>This system is my scaffold—external structure compensating for executive function challenges. But it's also a practice ground for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Showing up consistently (which builds trust)</li>
            <li>Communicating clearly (which builds relationships)</li>
            <li>Tracking progress (which builds confidence)</li>
            <li>Celebrating small wins (which sustains motivation)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The AI-Powered Approach</h2>
        <p>The system lives in a Git repository managed through Claude Code (Anthropic's coding CLI). This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Version control</strong>: Every change tracked, can review history, roll back if needed</li>
            <li><strong>AI assistance</strong>: Claude helps me process inbox items, plan projects, maintain structure</li>
            <li><strong>Automation</strong>: Scripts analyze my calendar, generate interfaces, sync data</li>
            <li><strong>Iterative evolution</strong>: The system grows with me, adapting as I learn what works</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Working in a coding environment might sound technical, but it gives me power: everything is plain text files that I can search, edit, link, and transform. No proprietary app lock-in. Complete control.</p>

        <h2>The Structure: Simple Interfaces, Complex Support</h2>

        <h3>Three Pillars of Daily Work</h3>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>The system centers on three simple touchpoints:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>inbox.md</strong> - Single capture point for everything (tasks, ideas, resources, insights)</li>
                <li><strong>next-actions.md</strong> - Context-based actions (@home, @calls, @computer, @anywhere)</li>
                <li><strong>Calendar</strong> - Time-blocked commitments</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>That's it for daily use.</strong> Everything else supports these three.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Full Architecture</h3>
        <p>Behind the scenes, the system integrates multiple methodologies:</p>

        <p><strong>GTD (Getting Things Done)</strong>: Capture → Clarify → Organize → Reflect → Engage</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear my head by capturing everything</li>
            <li>Process inbox daily: "What is this? Task? Resource? Insight?"</li>
            <li>Regular reviews (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Projects</strong>: Time-bound outcomes (Work System, Home Renovation, Hungary Trip)</li>
            <li><strong>Areas</strong>: Ongoing responsibilities (Health, Work, Family, Home, Financial)</li>
            <li><strong>Resources</strong>: Central vault for reference materials (research, docs, context)</li>
            <li><strong>Archives</strong>: Completed/inactive items</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Zettelkasten</strong>: Permanent notes for processed knowledge</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Atomic ideas with links between them</li>
            <li>Transform captured insights into lasting knowledge</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>PPV (Pillars, Pipelines, Vaults)</strong>: Strategic alignment</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Life pillars in VISION.md guide everything</li>
            <li>Projects are pipelines toward goals</li>
            <li>Resources are vaults of accumulated wisdom</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>

        <p><strong>Projects</strong> (<code>projects/*/</code>):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each has: roadmap.md (tasks), notes.md (context), resources.md (pointers)</li>
            <li>Example: Hungary Trip 2025 waiting for Moran's confirmation (tracked with "since" date)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Areas</strong> (<code>areas/*/</code>):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each has: tasks.md (one-time actions), practices.md (habits), resources.md</li>
            <li>Examples: Health (yoga 2x/week), Work (Sola PM role), Family, Home, Financial</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Resources</strong> (<code>resources/</code>):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Central vault (max 2 levels deep)</li>
            <li>Everything points here via resources.md files</li>
            <li>Includes: productivity research, work docs, scripts, historical conversations</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>ABOUT.md</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This is where our 130+ conversations live as context</li>
            <li>Your questions helped me articulate who I am, what I value, what I need</li>
            <li>It informs every decision in the system: "Does this align with my values? Is this sustainable?"</li>
            <li>The document opens with the ADHD diagnosis story you helped me understand</li>
            <li>It includes the transformation work we've done: learning to deliver consistently, building secure attachment, finding my voice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Makes It Work</h2>

        <h3>1. Built from Deep Self-Knowledge</h3>
        <p>The system is grounded in ABOUT.md—my story, values, needs, challenges. Everything we've worked on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ADHD diagnosis and what it means for how I work</li>
            <li>Learning to deliver before leading with brilliant ideas</li>
            <li>Building systems that compensate for executive function</li>
            <li>Understanding my patterns (Enneagram 9, INFP, trauma responses)</li>
            <li>Defining success: coming home energized, being present with kids, sustainable work</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your coaching conversations are literally embedded in the foundation. The questions you asked, the insights we discovered together—they shaped how this system thinks about me.</p>

        <h3>2. Simplicity at the Interface, Sophistication Behind</h3>
        <p>Daily use is dead simple:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check inbox → process items</li>
            <li>Open next-actions → pick by context and energy</li>
            <li>Check calendar → honor commitments</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But the system handles complexity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Projects with blockers tracked in multiple places</li>
            <li>Resources organized but accessible</li>
            <li>Knowledge building over time in zettelkasten</li>
            <li>Review cycles ensuring nothing falls through cracks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. AI as Co-Pilot, Not Autopilot</h3>
        <p>Claude doesn't run my life; it helps me run my life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Process this inbox item" → suggests which category, creates files, updates pointers</li>
            <li>"I want to plan a Hungary trip but waiting on Moran" → creates project structure, tracks blocker</li>
            <li>"Review my week" → pulls together all relevant files, helps me reflect</li>
            <li>"What's the pattern here?" → documents learnings in CLAUDE.md for future use</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The AI knows my context (ABOUT.md), my system (CLAUDE.md), and my current work (next-actions.md, projects). It's like having an assistant who actually understands me.</p>

        <h3>4. Progressive Disclosure</h3>
        <p>The system scales to complexity without requiring it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Day 1</strong>: Just use inbox and next-actions</li>
            <li><strong>Week 1</strong>: Add projects with roadmaps</li>
            <li><strong>Month 1</strong>: Build out area practices</li>
            <li><strong>Quarter 1</strong>: Develop zettelkasten knowledge base</li>
            <li><strong>Year 1</strong>: Full review cycles and strategic planning</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Right now, I'm at "Month 1" level—and it already works.</p>

        <h2>Current Status</h2>

        <p><strong>Migration Complete</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moved from old structure to unified system</li>
            <li>All work context migrated to central resources</li>
            <li>First real project (Hungary Trip) processed successfully</li>
            <li>System documented in CLAUDE.md for future reference</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Active Projects</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Work System (this!) - continuing to refine</li>
            <li>Home Renovation - blocked, but tracked</li>
            <li>Billion Person Focus Group - POC research at Sola</li>
            <li>Hungary Trip 2025 - waiting for go/no-go</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Daily Practice</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processing inbox (getting there)</li>
            <li>Updating next-actions (working on consistency)</li>
            <li>Time-blocking calendar (still building habit)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I'm Learning</h2>

        <p><strong>It's not about perfection</strong>:<br>
        The system accommodates messiness. Inbox doesn't have to be empty every day. Projects can be blocked. That's fine—it's all visible and tracked.</p>

        <p><strong>"Come back to the horse"</strong>:<br>
        When I fall off (and I will), the system makes it easy to get back on. No shame, just return.</p>

        <p><strong>Small wins compound</strong>:<br>
        Every processed inbox item builds confidence. Every completed task builds trust (with myself and others).</p>

        <p><strong>The system serves me, not vice versa</strong>:<br>
        When something doesn't work, I change it. The system evolves with my needs.</p>

        <h2>Why I'm Sharing This With You</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Sally, this system is a direct result of our work together. You helped me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand my ADHD and what accommodations I need</li>
                <li>Learn to deliver consistently before leading with vision</li>
                <li>Build secure attachment through expressing needs</li>
                <li>Define success on my own terms</li>
                <li>Trust that I'm valuable beyond being brilliant</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Every principle in ABOUT.md—every value, every insight, every "thing to keep in mind"—emerged from our conversations. The 130+ conversation transcripts sit in <code>resources/conversations/</code>, forming the foundation of how the system thinks about who I am and what I need.</p>

        <p>This isn't just a productivity system. It's an externalization of everything I've learned about how to work <em>with</em> my brain instead of against it. It's a practice ground for showing up consistently, communicating clearly, and building the life I actually want.</p>

        <p><strong>And it's working.</strong></p>

        <div class="tech-details">
            <h2>Technical Details (If You're Curious)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Platform</strong>: Git repository with Markdown files</li>
                <li><strong>AI</strong>: Claude Code (Anthropic's coding CLI)</li>
                <li><strong>Version control</strong>: Full history of every change</li>
                <li><strong>Automation</strong>: Python scripts for calendar analysis, data parsing</li>
                <li><strong>Structure</strong>: Plain text files organized by methodology</li>
                <li><strong>Access</strong>: Can work from terminal, VS Code, or any text editor</li>
                <li><strong>Backup</strong>: Git remote (GitHub) + local backups</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The beauty of plain text: it will work forever, on any system, with or without AI assistance. No app can disappear and take my life with it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="footer">
            <p><strong>This system is both a knowledge base and a workspace—everything needed to manage, track, and execute work lives in this repository. It's alive, evolving, and deeply personal.</strong></p>
