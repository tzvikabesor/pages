## Section 1: Work & Career → Current Role & Dynamics

### Question: What does success in your current role at Sola look like in 6 months?

**Answer:**
Success means that people at Sola can confidently answer *yes* to two questions:

1. Can you trust Tzvika to get things done once he takes responsibility?
2. Does Tzvika know what he’s talking about — even when it’s beyond his direct product scope?

Externally, that translates to consistent delivery, quality execution, and visible reliability. Internally, it means calm confidence — minimal stress, readiness, and being able to operate at a steady, self-directed pace.

**Indicators of Success:**

* Projects with Tzvika’s name on them are delivered on time and to high standards.
* If delays happen, they’re communicated early and resolved predictably.
* Stakeholders experience him as trustworthy, composed, and credible across domains.
* Tzvika feels prepared, not reactive — working proactively on what matters most rather than chasing what’s urgent.

**Risks to Success:**

* Taking on too much or moving too far ahead without alignment, creating sync debt and frustration.
* Neglecting communication loops, leading to anxiety in the system and reactive demands.
* Slipping into stress cycles that erode calm and clarity.

### Question: What are the early warning signs that you're slipping into old patterns with authority (either rebellion or over-compliance)?

**Answer:**
There isn’t a clear split between “underdrive” and “overdrive.” Overdrive creates both. When Tzvika runs ahead without sharing or involving others, frustration builds on both sides. He starts feeling misunderstood and viewing others as “stupid.” Meanwhile, others feel anxious and disconnected, responding with micromanagement or new demands.

**Warning Sign:**

> When people start to feel stupid — that’s the signal. It means he’s out of sync.

**Intervention:**
When this signal appears, the goal is to intercept it early. Recognize it as a cue to slow down, share context, and restore sync — before frustration and reactive work spiral.

Potential reset actions could include:

* Writing a quick 2-line update on current focus and next steps.
* Scheduling a 10-minute sync to realign.
* Pausing for a short breath/body scan to identify what’s actually needed.

---

### Question: What’s your ideal ratio of strategic/visionary work to execution/delivery work?

**Answer:**
It’s not a fixed ratio. Vision and execution are interdependent — they feed each other. The vision defines direction and meaning, while delivery earns credibility, generates evidence, and enables iteration on the vision. They’re two horses pulling the same carriage.

When delivery is grounded in a system — repeatable, visible, and reliable — it stops being a grind and becomes part of realizing the vision. Conversely, vision without delivery is speculation. The real goal is to build systems that connect the two so that both move in sync.

**Success Criteria:**

* Every major deliverable links directly to an articulated vision or hypothesis.
* Vision work regularly loops back into concrete, shippable outcomes.
* Delivery cadence feels predictable and light because systems handle repetition.

**Risks:**

* Losing sight of the vision when buried in tasks.
* Evangelizing ideas without proof or follow-through.
* Operating without systems — reinventing delivery each time, creating friction and burnout.

---

### Question: When you feel the urge to push hard on a strategic idea, how do you decide whether to advocate or let it go?

**Answer:**
This process feels like **“harsh water”** — firm but adaptive. Tzvika pushes hard initially, but if he encounters strong pushback or resistance, he doesn’t double down blindly. Instead, he listens, absorbs the constraints, and finds alternative paths that still advance the strategic goal — even if the direction changes slightly.

He focuses on *systemic progression* rather than tactical perfection. If implementation A isn’t possible but implementation B still moves the system in the right direction, he’ll take B. The key is to maintain forward motion within the broader system’s boundaries rather than getting stuck on form.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Always move the system forward — even if the path bends.

**Success Criteria:**

* Maintains alignment while keeping strategic intent alive.
* Converts resistance into data for recalibration, not conflict.
* Keeps projects advancing toward the broader goal, even through tactical compromises.

**Risks:**

* Over-adapting to pushback and diluting the vision.
* Losing sight of why the idea mattered in the first place.
* Mistaking motion for progress if the system isn’t actually improving.

---

### Question: How do you measure whether you're building the senior IC path you want vs. getting pulled into management?

**Answer:**
Tzvika uses Brian Balfour’s *players, captains, and coaches* framework as a reference. He strives to be a **captain** — leading on the field by doing. That means he guides, influences, and insists on standards, but doesn’t manage people. He wants to lead through expertise, impact, and clarity of thought, not through hierarchy.

He values **product craft** and user understanding over internal people management. Management is a different job — one that doesn’t excite him. What energizes him is working with the *people outside the organization* (users, clients), not managing the people inside it.

He recognizes that being a senior IC often means less formal influence than management roles, especially at Sola. But he’s committed to closing that gap over time by building credibility, delivering strong results, and becoming trusted as a **principal or staff-level PM** whose opinion carries strategic weight.

**Success Criteria:**

* Maintains hands-on product work and direct connection with users.
* Is sought out for judgment, not authority.
* Gains influence through trust and clarity rather than title.
* Feels energized by product challenges rather than drained by people management tasks.

**Risks:**

* Being pulled into management or coordination work that distracts from product depth.
* Underestimating how influence is built in management-heavy environments.
* Not advocating soon enough for the principal-level scope he’s already demonstrating.

## Section 2: Work & Career → AI & Future Direction

### Question: What specifically do you want to be known for in AI product work? What’s your unique angle?

**Answer:**
Tzvika’s unique focus is on the **human side of AI** — understanding human needs, user experiences, and emotional realities in an era where technology is rapidly evolving. He’s interested in ensuring that as AI becomes more powerful, product design and strategy don’t lose touch with human psychology, work patterns, and meaning.

He blends **intellectual rigor** (clarity about what AI does and doesn’t do) with **emotional rigor** (clarity about how humans experience it — cognitively, emotionally, and relationally). His goal is to design systems where AI augments human agency rather than confusing or replacing it.

He also brings a deep understanding of **systems and technology**, but his north star is how those systems shape — and are shaped by — human behavior. In practice, that means translating technical capabilities into emotionally coherent, psychologically sustainable experiences.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Keep AI human — intellectually, emotionally, and ethically.

**Success Criteria:**

* Known for bridging the gap between technical potential and human experience.
* Builds products that feel both powerful and humane.
* Advances conversations in the industry about responsible, user-centered AI design.

**Risks:**

* Getting pigeonholed as “the empathy person” instead of a strategic thinker.
* Under-communicating the technical and systemic sophistication behind his human-centered approach.
* Spreading too thin across philosophical and practical domains instead of choosing leverage points.

---

### Question: Are you genuinely excited about AI, or is this more strategic positioning?

**Answer:**
The excitement is fully genuine. Tzvika is deeply fascinated by the ability to work with machines that understand and process language — to collaborate with systems that can reason, reflect, and communicate. His interest isn’t opportunistic or trend-driven; it’s intrinsic.

He feels a strong sense of curiosity and creative potential in working with AI tools and models — including this very collaboration. While focusing on AI is also strategically smart, that wasn’t the motivation. The excitement comes from the *possibility itself* — from exploring what happens when human cognition and machine intelligence truly interact.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Follow genuine excitement; let strategy follow curiosity.

**Success Criteria:**

* Maintains a sense of wonder and creative engagement in AI work.
* Builds from authentic curiosity, not external pressure.
* Keeps the work playful and exploratory even while being rigorous.

**Risks:**

* Losing the sense of discovery under corporate or commercial constraints.
* Over-intellectualizing the excitement instead of letting it shape real experiments.

---

### Question: What would make you feel you've “arrived” as a thought leader in AI × Product?

**Answer:**
At this point, the answer is uncertain. Tzvika feels a genuine tension between two potential futures:

1. **Deepening in AI × Product** — becoming a respected voice and practitioner in human-centered AI.
2. **Redirecting toward social or civic impact** — applying his skills to more meaningful, socially grounded work, possibly even in public service.

He’s aware of this crossroads and doesn’t feel ready to decide. For now, the goal is to establish his foundation and credibility at **Sola**, maintaining excellence and calm while staying open to broader possibilities. Every few months, he intends to re-evaluate his direction — asking whether he wants to double down on product/AI thought leadership or pivot toward social and civic contribution.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Keep doing excellent work today while staying available to the larger question of purpose.

**Next Step:**
Revisit this question quarterly — reflect on which path feels more alive: continued growth in AI/product or transitioning toward social, ethical, or political impact.

**Risks:**

* Avoiding the decision for too long, leading to drift or divided focus.
* Overcommitting to current work without leaving space to explore long-term purpose.

---

### Question: How much technical depth do you want or need in AI versus staying at a strategic or human-centered level?

**Answer:**
Tzvika already operates with strong technical depth — roughly top 10% among product professionals. He’s fluent in implementing AI systems, integrating tools like **Cloud Code**, **VS Code**, and other frameworks, and understands model behavior conceptually. His learning doesn’t require deliberate effort; curiosity keeps him advancing naturally.

His growth edge now isn’t technical but **psychological and user-centered** — understanding human behavior, market needs, and emotional design in the AI era. He’s currently pursuing a course on market understanding with AI to strengthen this side.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Technical fluency is stable; the next frontier is human fluency.

**Success Criteria:**

* Maintains hands-on technical credibility without needing formal study.
* Expands depth in psychology, behavior, and market dynamics.
* Integrates human insights and emotional literacy into AI system design.

**Risks:**

* Over-relying on natural technical ability without continuing structured reflection.
* Neglecting deliberate skill-building in the human and social sciences that fuel long-term impact.

## Section 3: Work–Life Integration

### Question: What does “reducing work intensity while maintaining impact” mean in practice?

**Answer:**
Reducing work intensity isn’t about doing less — it’s about doing work so well and so systematically that less effort is required to maintain high impact. When systems, communication, and alignment are strong, there’s no need to chase; progress compounds naturally.

For Tzvika, this means staying ahead while continuously informing, collaborating, and incorporating stakeholder input. The goal is to work in a way that creates **space** — literal and mental — for reflection, rest, and creativity.

**Leading Indicator:**
He measures success by the *increase in time available during the work week* without any loss in output or influence. The more time he can block for deep thinking or even a full day off without things slipping, the stronger the system is.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Impact is measured by spaciousness — the quieter the week, the stronger the system.

**Success Criteria:**

* Maintains proactive alignment with stakeholders while working fewer reactive hours.
* System handles most operational weight without manual control.
* Can block more time for reflection and recovery during workweeks.

**Risks:**

* Using the freed-up time to take on new commitments instead of recovery or creative exploration.
* Equating busy-ness with importance.
* Losing rhythm by over-optimizing for calm rather than sustainable motion.

---

### Question: What would allow you to trust that you can work less without career consequences?

**Answer:**
Tzvika plans to approach reduced work intensity as a structured **experiment** rather than a leap of faith. He intends to begin by blocking **two hours per week** during regular work time for unstructured personal or reflective activity — e.g., listening to music, walking, or resting.

If productivity, alignment, and delivery remain stable, he’ll expand this incrementally — first to **three hours per week**, then **four**, and eventually up to **eight to ten hours** (roughly one workday). Each stage will be followed by a **bi-monthly review** to assess whether the reduced time maintains output quality and emotional calm.

If the experiment succeeds, he’ll eventually formalize it into a four-day workweek proposal supported by evidence of sustained impact.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Prove sustainability before asking permission — let results create trust.

**Success Criteria:**

* Maintains or improves work quality while reducing active hours.
* Conducts structured two-month reviews to evaluate system resilience.
* Feels increasing confidence and psychological safety in protecting downtime.

**Risks:**

* Expanding hours too quickly without system readiness.
* Using reclaimed time to multitask instead of rest or reflection.
* Failing to communicate experiment intent and success to management early enough.

---

### Question: How do you want to spend the time you reclaim from work?

**Answer:**
At least initially, reclaimed time isn’t about rest or leisure — it’s about **life infrastructure**. Tzvika wants to use that time for personal and household projects: home improvements, family logistics, and practical life management that tend to fall behind during high-intensity work cycles.

This is about rebalancing effort — shifting energy from corporate systems to personal systems. Over time, this may evolve into more restorative or creative use of time, but the first phase is pragmatic: building stability and order in the background of life.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Reduce work to invest in life — not escape it.

**Success Criteria:**

* Regularly dedicates reclaimed hours to advancing personal and home projects.
* Experiences visible progress in household organization and family flow.
* Feels greater control and calm in the physical and logistical aspects of life.

**Risks:**

* Filling reclaimed time with more structured “to-dos” instead of genuinely freeing bandwidth.
* Losing sight of the emotional purpose behind practical progress.

---

### Question: What’s preventing you from implementing time-boxing more systematically?

**Answer:**
The main blocker isn’t discipline — it’s **clarity**. Effective timeboxing requires a comprehensive view of everything that needs to be done, and Tzvika doesn’t always trust that he has that view. The uncertainty creates resistance to over-structuring.

There’s also a **psychological dimension**: with ADHD, even when managed by medication, there’s a learned distrust of full clarity. Operating in a slightly “fuzzy” landscape feels more natural and creative. Overly rigid plans can feel brittle or unrealistic.

The opportunity lies in designing a **“fuzzy-aware” timeboxing system** — one that accommodates partial knowledge and evolving clarity while still providing anchors for focus.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Build systems that can hold fuzziness, not eliminate it.

**Success Criteria:**

* Timeboxing built around dynamic, rolling priorities rather than fixed task lists.
* Uses blocks for focus modes (“deep work,” “alignment,” “maintenance”) instead of predefined tasks.
* Feels comfortable iterating the plan daily or weekly without guilt.

**Risks:**

* Confusing adaptive flexibility with lack of structure.
* Letting fuzziness become avoidance instead of creative space.

## Section 4: Personal Development & Growth

### Question: How has your sense of identity changed since the ADHD diagnosis? What’s still shifting?

**Answer:**
It’s an ongoing **re-mapping**. I’m noticing where past self-concepts were actually compensations (e.g., resisting timeboxing because it assumes a level of clarity that felt unsafe). I still catch myself unconsciously averting certain structures because they conflict with the way my brain explores and adapts. The work now is separating **essence** from **coping** and updating habits accordingly.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Redefine identity around strengths and needs, not around compensations.

**In Practice:**

* Treat “I can’t see the whole picture” as a design constraint, not a flaw.
* Prefer fuzzy-aware systems over brittle plans; iterate identity through action.

**Risks:**

* Mistaking old coping strategies for personality.
* Swinging to over-structure to “prove” control.

---

### Question: In five years, what’s different and what’s the same?

**Answer:**
No fixed picture by choice. Given family health and a volatile world, I’m investing in **capacities** that matter in any scenario: stronger body, steadier mind, and more mature systems. I want to be physically and mentally better, and more capable of seeing and addressing what holds me back — regardless of the external context.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Optimize for capacity under uncertainty.

**Near‑Term Focus:**

* Keep building systems that reduce friction.
* Maintain fitness and mental practices that scale with load.

---

### Question: What parts of the “old Tzvika” do you want to keep vs. what needs to evolve?

**Answer:**
**Keep:** the humble, connected **flow‑state** self — enjoying being part of the world, engaging with curiosity and presence.
**Evolve:** deeper **ease in belonging** — accepting that I’m liked, loved, and respected without needing to earn it every moment; letting this be a default, not a project.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Belonging isn’t earned minute‑by‑minute; it can be received.

---

---

## Section 5: Attachment & Relationships

### Question: What does secure attachment feel like for you now? How do you know when you’re there vs. not there?

**Answer:**
I feel like I’m entering a more secure attachment phase. It’s a personal process of **expressing needs and discovering that people don’t disappear** when I do. Each time I communicate a need and see that the relationship holds, trust grows — including with Moran. It’s no longer theoretical; it’s built through small, repeated experiences of stability.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Security isn’t declared — it’s proven through expression and continued presence.

**Markers:**

* I can name what I need without overexplaining.
* I stay connected even when there’s tension.
* I test trust gradually, not all at once.

---

### Question: How do you recognize when you’re hiding or performing versus being authentic?

**Answer:**
I don’t really perform. What I do is **translate** — I adjust how I express myself so others can receive it, but the source remains true. The intent is empathy, not impression management. Authenticity is always the base; what changes is the framing so that communication lands.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Translation isn’t performance when it serves understanding.

**In Practice:**

* Stay aware of when translation starts to dilute meaning.
* Keep emotional honesty even when phrasing shifts for empathy.

---

### Question: What makes it safe or unsafe to be vulnerable?

**Answer:**
It’s unsafe to be vulnerable only when **power meets insecurity** — when someone has authority or control but lacks inner stability. If a person in power feels threatened, reactive, or unable to hold other people’s emotions, I’ll instinctively withhold. Vulnerability needs grounded power around it.

**Guiding Principle:**

> I can be open anywhere that power is safe within itself.

**Safe Contexts:**

* Environments where power and empathy coexist.
* When feedback or disagreement doesn’t trigger defensiveness.
* When mutual curiosity replaces hierarchy.

**Unsafe Contexts:**

* Insecure or volatile authority figures.
* Situations where emotional honesty could be weaponized or misread.

---

---

## Section 6: Authority & Boundaries

### Question: What’s your relationship with authority now, and how has it changed?

**Answer:**
My view of authority has evolved. I now see that **people in power are often insecure** — that having authority doesn’t mean feeling safe or confident. This realization helps me approach authority with more empathy instead of opposition. It’s easier to stay grounded and constructive when I recognize that leadership often hides its own uncertainty.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Power doesn’t guarantee safety; empathy toward authority creates stability.

**In Practice:**

* Stay curious about what drives authority figures emotionally.
* Respond with steadiness rather than reactivity.
* Maintain self‑possession even when hierarchy feels tense.

---

### Question: How do you know when to advocate for yourself versus when to let something go?

**Answer:**
I tend to **let things go too easily** because I can contain the discomfort of not getting what I want. The downside is that this sometimes affects how I’m perceived — it subtly shapes expectations about what I’ll accept. I’m realizing that advocacy isn’t about ego; it’s about **positioning and integrity**. Sometimes, speaking up protects long‑term credibility, not just short‑term preference.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Containment is strength, but silence has a cost.

**Next Step:**

* Reframe self‑advocacy as part of professional stewardship.
* Track moments where I choose to stay silent and reflect on cumulative impact.

---

### Question: What would a healthy relationship with a boss look like — one where you neither rebel nor over‑comply?

**Answer:**
I want a **partnership**, not supervision. After a recent conversation with my boss, we aligned on shared ownership: I’m responsible for outcomes, delivery, and vision — including persuading others or being persuaded myself. Tactical concessions are fine if the larger sense of ownership remains. What’s missing and what I want to strengthen is a deeper sense of *joint stewardship* — something we both actively build.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Ownership isn’t isolation; it’s co‑responsibility.

**In Practice:**

* Increase transparency and feedback loops.
* Bring leadership into the loop earlier to nurture partnership.
* Balance autonomy with shared vision.

---

### Question: When you need to say “no,” what internal process helps — or what would make it easier?

**Answer:**
Saying no still feels internal and latent. I know how to do it, but I need to **manifest comfort within relationships** so the “no” feels natural, not oppositional. It’s about finding the interpersonal space where a boundary can live without creating distance — where refusal and respect coexist. I already have conviction; I’m working on comfort.

**Guiding Principle:**

> Say no from connection, not defense.

**Next Step:**

* Practice small, clear nos to normalize the feeling.
* Rehearse “relationship‑safe” refusals that protect connection while preserving limits.
