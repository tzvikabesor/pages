## Current Habits Status

### ðŸŸ¢ Consistent (Non-Negotiable)
- **Concerta 54mg daily** - ADHD medication, critical for executive function

### ðŸŸ¡ Compromised (Need to Restore)
- **Yoga 2x/week** - Currently not consistent, need to get back on track
- **Hydration** - Need to drink more water throughout day

### ðŸ”´ Paused (Need to Resume)
- **Body By Science strength training** - Stopped 6 weeks ago after 10-week run
  - See `projects/health/body-by-science.md` for principles and tracking
  - Need to find way back to gym

### ðŸ”µ Maintaining
- **Sleep** (7-8 hours) - Generally consistent, critical for ADHD management
- **Family time** - Non-negotiable priority, secure base

2. **Yoga** - Target: 2x/week minimum

## What Makes Habits Stick (Patterns to Watch)

### Enablers (What Helps)
- External structure and systems (compensate for ADHD)
- Physical wellbeing directly impacts everything else
- Clear "why" connected to values
- Small, sustainable increments
- Accountability/tracking
- [To be documented as patterns emerge]

### Barriers (What Hinders)
- Lack of external scaffolding
- "Forgetting to remember the future" (ADHD)
- Over-reliance on willpower vs. systems
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Shame when habits break (vs. "come back to the horse")
- [To be documented as patterns emerge]

## Current Focus: Restoration Phase

**Priority 1: Hydration**
- **Question**: What's the best way to drink more?
- **Experiments to try**:
  - [ ] Water bottle always visible on desk
  - [ ] Hydration app/reminders
  - [ ] Link to existing habits (every time I check Slack, drink water)
  - [ ] Track intake for awareness
  - [ ] [Other ideas to add]

**Priority 2: Yoga**
- **Status**: Compromised lately
- **Questions**:
  - What got in the way?
  - What worked during consistent periods?
- **Path back**:
  - [ ] Schedule specific times
  - [ ] Remove friction (mat always ready, etc.)
  - [ ] [Other ideas to add]

**Priority 3: Body By Science**
- **Status**: Stopped 6 weeks ago after 10 weeks of consistency
- **Questions**:
  - What worked during the 10 weeks?
  - What caused the break?
  - What needs to change to resume?
- **Path back**:
  - [ ] Review principles (see `projects/health/body-by-science.md`)
  - [ ] Schedule specific gym time
  - [ ] Address barriers that caused stop
  - [ ] [Other ideas to add]

## Habit Building Principles

### From ABOUT.md Context
1. **"Come back to the horse"** - Setbacks are normal, skill is returning quickly without shame
2. **Systems over willpower** - External structure compensates for executive function
3. **Physical wellbeing = medicine** - Not optional extras
4. **Process > outcome** - Journey IS the destination
5. **Sustainable > dramatic** - Steady progress serves you, quick wins don't

### For ADHD Management
- Distant things don't feel real/urgent without external systems
- Need to over-structure compared to neurotypical people
- Emotional regulation tied to physical state
- Hyperfocus can be asset or liability depending on direction

## Tracking Approach (To Be Developed)

**Options to consider**:
1. Weekly check-in (Friday review?)
2. Simple checkbox system
3. Notes on what helped/hindered each week
4. Celebrate small wins to sustain motivation
5. Connection to calendar/reminders

**Questions**:
- What level of tracking is sustainable vs. becomes burden?
- How to track without triggering shame when habits break?
- How to make tracking itself a habit?

## Integration with Work System

**Habits inform work capacity**:
- Sleep-deprived â†’ work suffers
- Not exercising â†’ emotional regulation fails
- Stressed at work â†’ less present with family
- Overwhelmed at home â†’ can't focus at work

**Work efficiency supports habits**:
- Time-blocking experiment creates space for health
- Better systems reduce work stress
- Work-free day (long game) allows proper recovery

**See**: ABOUT.md section on "The Integration of Work and Life"

## Next Steps

1. **Create Body By Science reference** - Document principles so Claude can track progress
2. **Experiment with hydration tracking** - Try different approaches for 2 weeks
3. **Analyze yoga consistency** - What worked before? What changed?
4. **Weekly habit review** - Add to Friday routine (with Jira review?)
5. **Connect to performance review prep** - How do habits support career goals?
