# August Bradley's Pillars, Pipelines & Vaults (PPV)

**Source**: August Bradley's Life Operating System
**Platform**: Designed specifically for Notion
**Year**: Launched 2019, started the "Notion Life OS" movement

## Overview

PPV (Pillars, Pipelines & Vaults) is a comprehensive life operating system designed to help organize and manage every aspect of life - not just work and tasks, but the entirety of personal and professional existence.

**Core Philosophy**: "Focus & Alignment"
- Create clarity about where you're going
- Review regularly to ensure you're on the right path
- Enable focused execution in day-to-day work

---

## The Three Core Components

### 1. Pillars üèõÔ∏è

**Definition**: Fundamental elements that sustain and define your life

**Purpose**:
- Represent the areas most important for achieving your "north star"
- Act as a filter: if an activity doesn't contribute to a Pillar, it's likely not relevant
- Categorize the key aspects of your life (not aspirations, goals, or responsibilities)

**Characteristics**:
- Typically 5-20 pillars depending on individual needs
- Examples might include: Health, Relationships, Career, Learning, Creativity, Finance, etc.

**Key Insight**: Pillars are the foundation - everything else flows from and connects back to them.

---

### 2. Pipelines ‚öôÔ∏è

**Definition**: Systems that connect elements for developing Pillars - your workflow structure describing the "what" and "how" for actions in life

**The Four-Tier Hierarchy**:

#### Tier 1: Value Goals
- **What**: Guiding principles for a particular pillar
- **Timeframe**: Long-term, aspirational
- **Example**: Under a "Health" pillar, a value goal might be "Stay physically and mentally healthy throughout life"
- **Purpose**: The "why" that connects to your pillars

#### Tier 2: Goal Outcomes
- **What**: Measurable resolutions that aspire to meet the value goal
- **Timeframe**: Quarterly/Monthly
- **Similarity**: Similar to OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
- **Example**: "Run a half-marathon by June" or "Reduce body fat to 15%"
- **Purpose**: Concrete, measurable targets that move you toward value goals

#### Tier 3: Projects
- **What**: The specific initiatives needed to achieve goal outcomes
- **Timeframe**: Reviewed weekly
- **Example**: "Create training plan", "Join running club", "Adjust diet"
- **Purpose**: Breaking down outcomes into manageable chunks of work

#### Tier 4: Action Items / Tasks
- **What**: The specific "what" and "how" that needs to be done to complete projects
- **Timeframe**: Daily execution
- **Example**: "Run 5km this morning", "Research running shoes", "Schedule physical therapy"
- **Purpose**: The actual work you do each day

**Flow**: Pillars ‚Üí Value Goals ‚Üí Goal Outcomes ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí Actions

### 3. Vaults üìö

**Definition**: Information repositories where you collect and consolidate knowledge to support execution of personal ambitions

**Purpose**:
- Personal knowledge database
- Can be aggregated according to Pillars or relation to Value Goals
- Support decision-making and execution with organized information

**Common Vault Types**:
- **Media Vault**: Books, videos, podcasts, articles
- **Courses & Training Vault**: Learning materials and certifications
- **Reference Vault**: Domain-specific knowledge bases
- **Ideas Vault**: Captured thoughts and inspirations

**Key Feature**: Vaults integrate Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) - screening, capturing, organizing, optimizing information, then resurfacing the most valuable knowledge at the right time and place for action.

---

## Supporting System: Cycles üîÑ

**Definition**: Review sessions that optimize the system for error recovery and redundancy

**Purpose**: Ensure work remains consistent with Pipelines and Pillars

**Review Cadence**:
- **Yearly**: Review north star, Pillars, Value Goals
- **Quarterly**: Review Goal Outcomes and OKRs
- **Monthly**: Ensure projects align with quarterly goals
- **Weekly**: Review projects and plan actions

**Philosophy**: Continuous recalibration over rigid planning - allows for "emergence" of relevant work without planning stress

---

## Three Primary Objectives

### 1. **Focus** üéØ
- Encourage Flow state when you need it most
- Sit down, see what needs to be done, immediately start working
- Eliminate decision fatigue and context-switching
- Clear next actions always visible

### 2. **Alignment** üß≠
- Ensure work is directed toward the right goals
- Maintain connection between daily actions and life aspirations
- Filter out activities that don't serve your pillars
- Regular reviews keep you on course

### 3. **Knowledge** üí°
- Quick access to personal knowledge when needed
- Capture and organize information efficiently
- Resurface relevant knowledge at the right time
- Build a personal knowledge base that grows with you

---

## Key Principles

### Systems Thinking Approach
- Life as an interconnected system, not isolated domains
- Everything relates back to core pillars
- Bottom-up execution meets top-down strategy

### Flexibility Over Rigidity
- System adapts to changing life circumstances
- Designed for emergence, not just planning
- Regular reviews allow for course correction

### Integration of PKM
- Knowledge management deeply integrated into the productivity system
- Information isn't separate from execution - it supports it
- Vaults make knowledge actionable

### Notion-Native Design
- Leverages Notion's database capabilities
- Relations between databases create powerful connections
- Flexible views adapt to different contexts and needs

---

## Implementation Characteristics

**Setup**:
- Requires significant upfront effort to establish
- Comprehensive video series available for learning
- Course available for faster onboarding

**Benefits**:
- Comprehensive life management in one system
- Clear connection between daily work and life purpose
- Powerful knowledge management integrated with action
- Regular review structure maintains alignment

**Considerations**:
- Can be complex for beginners
- Requires commitment to maintain
- Notion-dependent (not platform-agnostic)
- May be overwhelming for those preferring simpler systems

## Relevance to Our Work System

### Current Alignments

Our existing system already has some PPV-like elements:

- **VISION.md** ‚Üí Similar to Pillars (life direction)
- **ROADMAP.md** ‚Üí Similar to Projects/Actions (execution focus)
- **PROJECTS.md** ‚Üí Similar to Projects tier
- **ideas/** folder ‚Üí Could evolve toward Value Goals
- **.claude/knowledge.md** ‚Üí Similar to Vaults (knowledge capture)

### Potential Inspirations

**What PPV Does Well**:
1. **Clear hierarchy** from life purpose down to daily actions
2. **Explicit review cycles** at multiple time scales
3. **Integration of knowledge management** with execution
4. **Filter mechanism** (Pillars) for deciding what matters
5. **Alignment emphasis** - constantly connecting back to purpose

**What We Might Adapt**:
1. **Goal Outcomes tier** - we lack measurable quarterly/monthly goals
2. **Value Goals concept** - explicit principles that guide work
3. **Cycles/Reviews structure** - formal review cadences
4. **Vault organization** - more structured knowledge capture
5. **Alignment checks** - regular verification that work serves purpose

**What to Consider Carefully**:
- PPV can be heavy/complex - may not suit everyone
- Our system's simplicity is also a strength
- Platform dependency (Notion) vs. our markdown approach
- Balance between structure and flexibility

## Questions for Future Exploration

1. **Do we need a tier between VISION.md and current projects?**
   - Something like "Value Goals" or yearly objectives?

2. **Should we formalize review cycles?**
   - Weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews explicitly in the system?

3. **How do we better connect daily work to life purpose?**
   - Is our connection between ABOUT.md ‚Üí VISION.md ‚Üí ROADMAP.md ‚Üí tasks clear enough?

4. **Could we structure knowledge capture more deliberately?**
   - Multiple "vaults" instead of one knowledge.md?

5. **Do we need a filtering mechanism like Pillars?**
   - Explicit life areas that help prioritize and filter work?

## Notes

This document captures PPV as inspiration for evolving our work system. The goal is not to replicate PPV, but to:
- Learn from its well-thought-out structure
- Consider what concepts might enhance our system
- Maintain awareness of alternative approaches
- Allow our system to evolve based on changing needs

As we capture more inspirations, we'll be able to see patterns and principles that resonate, and thoughtfully incorporate them while maintaining what works about our current approach.
