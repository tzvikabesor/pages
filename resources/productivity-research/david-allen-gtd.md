## Overview

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a personal productivity system and time management methodology developed by David Allen. It's one of the most influential productivity systems ever created, with millions of practitioners worldwide over 20+ years.

**Core Philosophy**:
> "There is an inverse relationship between things on your mind and those things getting done."

The more information you're mentally keeping track of, the less productive and focused you are. GTD encourages you to store all work information in an external, organized system.

**Goal**: Achieve a "mind like water" state - perfect readiness to respond appropriately to any input, then return to calm.

---

## The Five-Step Workflow

GTD operates through five fundamental steps that process everything that has your attention:

### 1. Capture 📥

**Definition**: Collect everything that has your attention

**What to Capture**:
- Tasks and to-dos
- Ideas and thoughts
- Commitments and promises
- Things that bother you
- Projects you want to do
- Anything that's "on your mind"

**Key Principle**: Get it OUT of your head and INTO a trusted system

**Capture Tools**:
- Physical inbox (papers, notes)
- Digital inbox (email, notes app)
- Voice memos
- Quick capture notebook
- Any reliable external system

**Important**: Capture EVERYTHING, including items that take 2 minutes or less - you'll process them in the next step.

**Goal**: Empty your mind of all open loops so it can focus on thinking, not remembering.

---

### 2. Clarify 🔍

**Definition**: Process what each item means and what to do about it

**The Clarification Workflow**:

For each captured item, ask:
1. **What is it?**
2. **Is it actionable?**

#### If NOT Actionable:
- **Trash** - Delete/discard it
- **Reference** - File it for later (might need someday)
- **Someday/Maybe** - Might want to do later, but not now

#### If Actionable:
3. **What's the next action?** (Define the very next physical, visible action)
4. **Can it be done in under 2 minutes?**
   - **YES** → Do it now (The Two-Minute Rule)
   - **NO** → Continue to step 5

5. **Am I the right person to do it?**
   - **NO** → Delegate it (track in "Waiting For")
   - **YES** → Continue to step 6

6. **Is this part of a larger outcome?**
   - **YES** → It's a Project (add to Projects list)
   - **NO** → It's a standalone action

7. **When should/could it be done?**
   - **Specific date/time** → Add to Calendar
   - **As soon as possible** → Add to Next Actions list
   - **Specific date to review** → Add to Tickler/Future file

**Key Insight**: You're not deciding whether to DO it yet - just what it IS and what the next action would be.

---

### 3. Organize 🗂️

**Definition**: Put reminders of categorized items in appropriate places

**The GTD Lists and Buckets**:

#### Core Action Lists:

**Next Actions**
- Single, specific, physical actions that can be done immediately
- Organized by context (see below)
- This is your primary working inventory

**Projects**
- Any outcome requiring more than one action
- Most people have 30-100 active projects
- Reviewed regularly to ensure progress

**Waiting For**
- Actions you've delegated or are awaiting response
- Track what you're waiting for and from whom
- Review regularly to follow up

**Calendar**
- Only for things with specific dates/times
- Sacred space - only time-specific items
- Three types:
  - Time-specific actions (meetings, appointments)
  - Day-specific actions (must happen on this day)
  - Day-specific information (deadlines, events)

**Someday/Maybe**
- Things you might want to do but not now
- Projects you're not committed to yet
- Dreams, ideas, possibilities
- Reviewed periodically

#### Supporting Structures:

**Reference**
- Non-actionable information you want to keep
- Can be general (filing system) or project-specific
- Easily accessible when needed

**Tickler File**
- Future reminders that pop up on specific dates
- "Tickle your memory" on the right day
- Physical (43 folders) or digital

#### Contexts

Next Actions are organized by **context** - the tool, place, or circumstance needed to do the action:

Common contexts:
- @Computer
- @Phone
- @Office
- @Home
- @Errands
- @Anywhere (can do anywhere with phone/laptop)
- @Agenda (items to discuss with specific people)
- @Waiting For
- @Read/Review

**Why Contexts?** When you have a specific tool or are in a specific place, you want to see only the actions you can do in that context.

---

### 4. Reflect 🔄

**Definition**: Review your system regularly to maintain trust and clarity

**The Weekly Review** (Critical Success Factor):

**Purpose**: Keep your system current, complete, and trusted

**Steps**:
1. **Get Clear**: Empty inboxes, process notes
2. **Get Current**: Review calendar (past week & upcoming)
3. **Get Creative**: Review all lists:
   - Next Actions (by context)
   - Projects (each one - is progress happening?)
   - Waiting For (follow up on delegated items)
   - Someday/Maybe (anything to activate?)
4. **Get Complete**: Capture new items, update lists

**Frequency**: Weekly (Friday afternoon is common)

**Duration**: 1-2 hours typically

**Importance**: David Allen calls this a "critical factor for success" - without regular reviews, your system becomes stale and you lose trust in it.

**Other Review Cycles**:
- **Daily**: Check calendar, scan next actions
- **Monthly**: Review bigger goals and areas of focus
- **Quarterly/Annually**: Review higher horizons

**Goal**: Confidence that you're not just doing things, but doing the RIGHT things.

---

### 5. Engage 🎯

**Definition**: Use your trusted system to choose what to do with confidence

**The Four Criteria Model** (for choosing actions in the moment):

When deciding what to do right now, consider:

1. **Context**: What can I do given my current location/tools?
2. **Time Available**: How much time do I have right now?
3. **Energy Available**: What's my current mental/physical state?
4. **Priority**: Given the above, what's most important?

**Key Insight**: You're not making these decisions from scratch - you're choosing from a pre-clarified, organized list of options. This eliminates decision fatigue.

**The Threefold Model** (for evaluating daily work):

At any moment, you're doing one of three types of work:

1. **Predefined Work**: Doing tasks from your Next Actions lists
2. **Work As It Shows Up**: Responding to new inputs as they arrive
3. **Defining Your Work**: Processing inboxes, reviewing, clarifying

Balance all three - don't just react (type 2) or just plan (type 3).

## The Six Horizons of Focus

GTD uses an altitude metaphor to describe different levels of perspective:

### Ground/Runway: Current Actions
- **What**: Calendar and Next Actions
- **Perspective**: Day-to-day tasks
- **Volume**: High (hundreds of actions)
- **Review**: Daily

### Horizon 1: Projects
- **What**: Multi-step outcomes to achieve
- **Perspective**: Outcomes over next few weeks/months
- **Volume**: 30-100 projects typically
- **Review**: Weekly

### Horizon 2: Areas of Focus & Accountability
- **What**: Roles and responsibilities
- **Perspective**: What is my job? What am I responsible for?
- **Volume**: 5-15 areas typically
- **Review**: Monthly
- **Examples**: Health, Finances, Career Development, Team Leadership, Home Maintenance

### Horizon 3: Goals (1-2 Years)
- **What**: Things you want to achieve in the next year or two
- **Perspective**: Where do I want to be?
- **Volume**: Handful of major goals
- **Review**: Quarterly
- **Examples**: Get promoted, launch product, learn a new skill

### Horizon 4: Vision (3-5 Years)
- **What**: Longer-term trajectory and direction
- **Perspective**: What will my life/work look like?
- **Volume**: Few major visions
- **Review**: Annually
- **Examples**: Career direction, lifestyle, organization's direction

### Horizon 5: Purpose & Principles
- **What**: Why do you exist? What's your mission?
- **Perspective**: Ultimate "big picture"
- **Volume**: One core purpose
- **Review**: Rarely (but foundational)
- **Questions**: What's the job and lifestyle I want? Why am I here?

**Key Principle**: Lower horizons support higher horizons. Actions (ground) serve Projects (H1), which serve Areas (H2), which serve Goals (H3), etc.

**Review Bottom-Up**: Weekly review focuses on Ground-H2, less frequent reviews climb higher horizons.

## The Natural Planning Model

GTD's approach to planning any project or outcome:

### The Five Stages:

#### 1. Define Purpose & Principles
- **Why** are we doing this?
- What are the guiding principles?
- Clarifies motivation and boundaries

#### 2. Envision Outcome
- What would success look like?
- What's the desired result?
- Creates clear target

#### 3. Brainstorm
- How might we achieve this?
- Generate ideas without judgment
- Quantity over quality initially

#### 4. Organize
- Identify components, sequences, priorities
- Structure the brainstormed ideas
- What are the key pieces?

#### 5. Identify Next Actions
- What's the very next physical action?
- Who does it?
- Make it concrete and doable

**Key Insight**: This is how we naturally plan things in our minds. GTD makes it explicit and external.

**Use**: Apply to any project, from life goals to weekend trips.

---

## Key Concepts & Principles

### The Two-Minute Rule
> "If an action will take less than two minutes, do it now when you first pick it up."

**Why?** It takes longer to organize and track a 2-minute task than to just do it.

**When to Apply**: During the Clarify step when processing captured items.

**Benefits**:
- Immediate wins and progress
- Reduces list clutter
- Builds momentum

### Mind Like Water
Martial arts concept: Water responds perfectly to any force, then returns to calm.

**In GTD**:
- Respond appropriately to inputs
- Not under- or over-reacting
- Return to clear, ready state
- Present and focused

**Achieved By**: Trusted system that holds everything, regular processing, clear mind.

### Trusted System
Your external system must be:
- **Complete**: Everything is captured
- **Current**: Regularly updated
- **Organized**: Easy to find things
- **Reviewed**: Maintained consistently

**Result**: You trust it completely, so your mind can let go.

### Open Loops
Anything pulling on your attention that doesn't belong where it is.

**Examples**:
- Unprocessed emails
- Unclear commitments
- Things in your head
- Incomplete projects

**Goal**: Close all open loops by capturing, clarifying, and organizing them.

### Inbox Zero
Process all inboxes to empty regularly.

**Not about**: Responding to everything immediately

**About**:
- Deciding what each item means
- Organizing appropriately
- Keeping inboxes as processing stations, not storage

**Frequency**: Every 24-48 hours ideal

### Next Action Thinking
Always define the very next PHYSICAL, VISIBLE action.

**Not**: "Project plan" or "Website" (vague)

**But**: "Email Jane for project requirements" or "Draft homepage wireframe" (specific)

**Why?**: Removes ambiguity, lowers resistance, enables action.

## Challenges & Considerations

### Common Obstacles:

**1. Initial Setup Time**
- Requires significant upfront investment (6-16 hours)
- Can feel overwhelming at first
- Must process all existing open loops

**2. Discipline Required**
- Weekly review is non-negotiable but easy to skip
- Daily processing needs to become habit
- System only works if maintained

**3. Over-Organization Risk**
- Can spend too much time organizing
- Might over-engineer the system
- Balance between process and action

**4. Context Rigidity**
- Contexts can become too granular
- Modern work blurs context lines (@Computer for everything)
- May need to adapt traditional contexts

**5. Projects List Can Overwhelm**
- Seeing 50-100 projects can be daunting
- Need to accept you can't do everything at once
- Weekly review helps manage this

### When GTD Works Best:

- Knowledge workers with many diverse inputs
- People juggling multiple projects and responsibilities
- High-volume environments
- Need for reliability and completeness
- Self-directed work

### When GTD Might Not Fit:

- Single-focus work with few inputs
- Highly routine/repetitive work
- Very simple work situations
- Those preferring minimal structure
- Resistance to systematic approaches

## Relevance to Our Work System

### Current Alignments

Our system has GTD-like elements:

- **ROADMAP.md**: Similar to Projects + Next Actions lists
- **"Waiting For" section**: Direct GTD concept
- **Task status tracking**: [ ], [-], [x] like GTD
- **PROJECTS.md**: Like GTD Projects list
- **Periodic updates**: Similar to GTD reviews

### Key Differences

1. **GTD**: Bottom-up (capture everything → organize → engage)
   **Ours**: More top-down (vision → projects → tasks)

2. **GTD**: Context-based next actions
   **Ours**: Priority and status-based

3. **GTD**: Separate Someday/Maybe
   **Ours**: Backlog section (similar concept)

4. **GTD**: Weekly review as core ritual
   **Ours**: Less formalized review process

5. **GTD**: Tool and technique focused
   **Ours**: Purpose and vision focused

### Potential Inspirations

**What GTD Does Well**:

1. **Capture Everything**
   - No mental holding of tasks
   - Trusted system principle
   - Inbox zero mentality

2. **Next Action Clarity**

   - "Is it actionable? What's the next action?"
   - Better capture-to-action flow

6. **Someday/Maybe Separation**
   - Distinguish "active backlog" from "maybe someday"
   - Reduce pressure on what's "in progress"
   - Review periodically without commitment

7. **Horizons Framework**
   - We have Vision/Projects/Tasks
   - Could add explicit intermediate levels
   - Areas of Responsibility, Goals, etc.

### What to Keep from Our System:

- **Purpose-oriented** (GTD doesn't emphasize this as much)
- **Vision-driven** (connects to why, not just what)
- **Project-based structure** (clearer hierarchy)
- **Simple priority levels** (High/In Progress/Backlog)
- **Markdown/plain text** (more portable than most GTD tools)
- **Knowledge capture** (GTD focuses on actions more than learnings)

---

## Integration Possibilities

### GTD + PARA:
- PARA provides file organization
- GTD provides action management
- Complementary systems

### GTD + PPV:
- PPV provides purpose/values (Pillars)
- GTD provides execution (workflow)
- PPV's Pipeline hierarchy + GTD's action management
- PPV's Cycles = GTD's Reviews

### GTD + Our System:
- Our Vision/Purpose (top-down clarity)
- GTD's Workflow (bottom-up execution)
- Our roadmap structure + GTD's next actions
- Our knowledge capture + GTD's action system

## Questions for Future Exploration

1. **Should we adopt Next Action thinking?**
   - Make task descriptions more specific?
   - "Very next physical action" standard?

2. **Would contexts help us?**
   - @Computer, @Office, @Phone, @Anywhere
   - Or are our current priority levels sufficient?

3. **Do we need a formal Weekly Review?**
   - Scheduled time to review all lists
   - Comprehensive system update
   - Keep everything current

4. **Should we separate Someday/Maybe from Backlog?**
   - Backlog = will do eventually
   - Someday/Maybe = might do someday
   - Different psychological pressure

5. **Could we use the Two-Minute Rule?**
   - Quick wins on small tasks
   - Immediate action on capture
   - Reduce task list size

6. **Do we need explicit Waiting For tracking?**
   - We have it in ROADMAP.md
   - But do we review it regularly?
   - Follow up systematically?

7. **Should we map our work to Horizons?**
   - Ground: ROADMAP.md tasks
   - H1: PROJECTS.md
   - H2: Could add Areas of Responsibility
   - H3-5: VISION.md, ABOUT.md
   - Help connect levels?

## Key Takeaways

GTD is fundamentally about:

1. **Getting things out of your head** → Trusted external system
2. **Clarifying what things mean** → Is it actionable? What's the next action?
3. **Organizing by action** → Contexts, projects, waiting for
4. **Reviewing regularly** → Keep system current and trusted
5. **Choosing with confidence** → Context, time, energy, priority

**Core Wisdom**:
> "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them."

**Most Valuable Principles**:
- Next action thinking (specificity enables action)
- Weekly review (maintenance creates trust)
- Two-minute rule (quick wins reduce friction)
- Horizons of focus (connect actions to purpose)
- Mind like water (appropriate response, then calm)

**Most Applicable to Our System**:
- Next action specificity
- Weekly review ritual
- Waiting For tracking
- Two-minute rule
- Context awareness

**Different Philosophy**:
- GTD is bottom-up (process inputs → define actions)
- Our system is top-down (vision → projects → tasks)
- Both have value - could be combined

## Notes

GTD is the grandfather of modern productivity systems. It's been battle-tested for 20+ years and has influenced virtually every productivity system that came after it (including PARA and PPV).

**What makes GTD special**:
- Comprehensive workflow (capture → clarify → organize → reflect → engage)
- Clear decision rules (two-minute rule, contexts, next actions)
- Trusted system principle (get it all out of your head)
- Weekly review (maintenance is built in)
- Tool-agnostic (works with anything)

**Why it's lasted**:
- Addresses fundamental human challenges (too much to remember, too many inputs)
- Provides clear process, not just philosophy
- Flexible enough to adapt to different contexts
- Simple core concepts, scalable complexity

**For our system**: GTD offers proven execution practices that could complement our vision-driven approach. The weekly review, next action thinking, and context awareness are particularly valuable.
